Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass."

I've never had the Budvar Cristal but this is exactly what I imagined it to be.  A clean and refreshing, hoppy beer, med bodied with plenty of flavor.

Aromas and tastes of grain, very lightly fruity with a light grassy finish. Lively yet thin and watery body.

Poured an opaque black color with a creamy tan head and nice lacing.  Strong vanilla and roasted malt aroma.  Creamy taste of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. The bartender told me this was an imperial stout at about 8%.  She didn't convince me, there was no alcohol to be found, and it was sweet as hell!  But still good."

Had the regular and cask version. Poured a deep brown color with an averaged sized off white head (cask had a huge head).

Darkish copper colored, with no head -	probably poured like that on purpose.	Served inappropriately at about 40 deg	F.  This beer was cold.  It tasted	fine at that temp but I had to let it warm up 	for awhile.  It was worth the wait, as a	very interesting and complex character developed.	Very phenolic and funky - with a strong ester of	bubblegum.  Also a little clove or some kind of 	spice.  Strong but not overwhelming at all.  Surpisingly	easy to drink."

The fruit flavors are very apparent, but the natural mildness of the currants keep the sweetness in check.  These flavors blend well with the white beer base."

Thus, overly creamy and lacking	some of its original flavor.  I could tell there	was a pretty good beer in there.  Aroma difficult	to detect."

Pours a nice dark copper color with medium size off white head. Aroma of bourbon, malt , hops and oak. Slight smokey flavor with a bourbon taste in the initial sip.

Interesting experiment, but I liked regular Hopula better. Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma is slightly wood and hops, but mostly bourbon. Flavor is everything I loved about Hopula, but with too much booze. Some nice vanilla notes, but bourbon constantly overpowers the Hopula. Just not my style, but would be very interesting if they reused the barrels."

Pours dark mahogany with a medium lasting head and great lacing.  Flavor is strong bourbon, too strong.  The base beer is hidden under there somewhere but is way overpowered.  I had trouble getting it down to be honest."

The aroma has lots of vanilla and some bourbon and toasty malt.  Medium sticky body with light carbonation.  The flavor starts with the aroma traits with more caramel malt and earthy hops.  The finish has vanilla and okay dominating everything.  This kind of beer is just not down my alley.

The aroma picked up an interesting interplay of juicy floral notes, sweet bourbon, and vanilla.. unfortunately interesting in a way that they didnt really go together.. muted the IIPA-ness greatly.  The flavor was on the sweet side with restrained floral and earthy bitterness (likely due to aging).. lots of barrel again with sour bourbon and oak all over.. finished bourbon-ey with even more barrel.  Too sour on the palate, again with too much of the barrel."

Taste is smooth, clean brown style malt with a perfectly balanced sour profile bringing in the brett flavor. I was skeptical of the at first, but it came out quite nicely IMHO.

The aroma has notes of bakers chocolate, toasty and charred malt, prune and starfruit esters, star anise, floral and herbal hops, a hint of rubber and pipe tobacco. The taste has a Schwarzbier like dry toasty black malt character with a ripened fruity backbone. A bit sugary in midesection and anise spice all over the place. Peaty bite and a hint of sea salt too. The mouth feel is the weak part of the beer, sort of just sits there on the palate offering nothingness. A good beer for what it is but I think I would rather have a New Belgium 1554 first."

The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.		Lightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.		Other than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it."

Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.		her sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.		Overall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary.

The yeast takes on a bigger role here, adding deep fruits, overripe banana, plums and more.  Drinks well and has an interesting complexity."

I found this bottle in a small liquor store in Granite City, Illinois.  I bought it as part of a pick-n-pack combination.  BIB IPA pours murky orange with large pulp and a medium semi-soapy looking head.  The combination of the pulp and the murkiness is a bit disconcerting if youve never had an unfiltered beer.  Even with experience the darker beer color doesnt look appetizing.  The nose is mostly hop-generated citrus with a very faint malt tone.  The body is oily and surprisingly thick for an IPA but it works well.   The hop bitterness is quite prevalent, pushing most other flavors to the side.  A touch of heather or clover peeks through though.  This beer isnt bad but the bitterness is more reminiscent of an imperial IPA than a straight IPA.  This is probably a local favorite but falls just a little shy when compared to some of the American great IPAs."

This beer poured a dark brownish copper color with a foamy beige head that slowly faded.  Some uneven, sticky lace was left around the glass.  The aroma consisted of a big citrus/grapefruit presence followed up by a nice caramel malt backbone.  The flavor was super hoppy, with sweet grapefruit flavors giving way to the roasted caramel, and finishing just slightly bitter.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation.  This is an excellent brew, done in the same vein as Alpha King.  Very tasty, and vastly underappreciated."

Not too bitter; not too sweet. Mouthfeel, for this size beer, is has a pleasant unexpected stickyness. I concur with many that this makes a great session IPA in an age of big beers."

Im not entirely sure what that means, but this was a very drinkable beer that would make a nice session beer...  Barly IPA pours out in a thick looking stream.  It is dark amber and opaque in the glass.  It has a dense, frothy, and lasting beige head that also leaves some lacing.  The aroma is orange, citrus, and sweet pinapple.  The flavor has a smooth, malty backbone balanced by a juicy citrus bitterness.  The bitterness level is fairly substantial, but isnt offensive since it is so well balanced by the hefty, sweet caramel  maltiness.  Not only is the flavor great, but this beer is smooth on the palate and has a nearly creamy texture.  The body is medium to medium-full.  This is a great IPA and really underrated, in my opinion.  	12 oz bottle from The Hop Shop in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Shared with Rob at our weekly/bi-weekly beer tasting."

It says unfiltered/unpasteurized on the bottles, though it dosent say bottle conditioned.  The bottle of barrel-aged oatmeal stout was one of the most filtered, watery, loose tasting beers Ive ever had nor did it have any sediment.  This one, howver, has some definite protein dropout, which despite my best efforts got in to my glass, and the very last shot in the bottle (for experimentation) is completely cloudy.  The ruby-auburn-tinged caramel body is light on carbonation, though a fair amount of dark beige head does form, showing medium retention and little/no lacing.Sweet cherries and strawberries in the nose brush against the nose rather coarsely, while leafy, green hop aromatics provide grapefruit and orange rind notes.  Definite crystal maltiness sweetens things to a point, then seems to harden and dry out, with light yeast doughiness and moderate breadiness.  Every subsequent smell, however, is alive with fresh hop aromatics, fruity esters and balanced, sweet malt, it just seems to suffer on the finish, somewhat.  So based on the aroma, I suppose the evidence is in favor of it being unpasteurized at least.  Well have to leave it to the flavor/texture to determine the rest.Bittersweet malt and hops collide, with a strong earthiness and tangy grapefruit flavors that both give way to a ruby red grapefruit sweetness mixed with cherries and moderate herbal notes.  Whatever the medium malt being used, it comes across clearly and quite well.  The caramel-toffee sweetness is well matched and for once some hop acidity is much appreciated in balancing it.  Mostly substantial texture, with moderately engaging carbonation.  Ok, Ill buy that this stuff is lightly to not filtered and just conditioned well.

Bitter and bone-dry, on the resiny side of the hopcoin, yet not really oily.  Grapefruit and citrus, indeed, but light caramel, too.   Aftertaste is a mix of hops and drying darjeeling.

Pours a pleasing orangey IPA color, with the carbonation surging into a fluffy head that shortly dissolves to lacing. Pretty clear until you spot the microscopic Bells-type floaties. Taste to my mind is again more of big resiny pine boughs than citrus. But still, its very tasty and filling, and brings out the malts, which appear to be a tad darker in roast than other IPA, a bit more caramel and over-toasted bagel.

Pretty damn good for a Brown Ale, even manages to avoid most notes of sweetness... but still, just a brown ale."

Aroma of bakers chocolate and caramel with a touch of warm fermented fruitiness but lacking complexity.  Flavor and aroma are one with the addition of a nice, long bitterness and hop flavor that extends the finish and some milk on the palate.

Rather dry with a low fruitiness, but overall pretty nice.		4.0 T: Taste is much like the nose. Nutty, toasty, biscuity malts, and toffee are all there again. Theres a barely detectable almost buttery flavor (though not exactly buttery) than complements the flavors well. A little sweeter than the nose suggests, but not much. Hops are mainly earthy with a touch of citrus.		4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate spritzy carbonation.

I prefer a head thats a bit more even but this is nice too. Pine hops up front in the nose w/ an woody undercurrent. Hop bitterness is firm but a bit on the soapy side. Really not bad though. The biggest problem this beer has is that its overcarbonated which makes it come across as a bit watery and drowns out any sort of malt depth this might otherwise have. It is very sharp on the tong which detracts from drinkability somewhat as well.

A faint caramelly-molasses-nutty aroma is barely evident.  The flavor is even more elusive which is okay based on what can be found which includes: steeped roasted malt or bark, sour/burnt malt and fruit but sometimes vacantly sweet, and something slightly nutty.  Weird.  Doesnt even quite cut it to be just ""average"".  This beer feels overly thin and watery on the palate and is completely unexciting.  Overall this is a very disappointing beer that misses the mark.

Pours a hazy burgundy with a finger of somewhat creamy, beige head that diminishes to a thin cap. The nose is of a somewhat astringent burnt caramel that transitions to an ""off"" phenolic/plastic note; not terribly enticing. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and almost creamy-slick, finishing mildly dry and astringent. The flavor follows the nose with an additional roasted nut note. This is a decent brown, but the astringency and plastic note detract from the overall effect. Its not bad, but its not particularly good either."

The body was opaque with no visible carbonation and light black in color.  The aroma was very nice with malt molasses and brown beer notes and a mildly vinous coffee scent.  The mouth feel was initially very thick with malty and mild coffee notes and a lingering mild coffee malt bite in the finish.  The flavor was thick with malt and coffee notes.

Sweet malt nose as befits the style.  Mouthfeel is full and smooth.  The initial taste is dry, but gives way to a proper sweet aftertaste.  Surprisingly complex, but not deeply so.  Decent effort."

Nice deep brown color with a creamy dark tan head.  There was a good smoky aroma that overpowered anything else that may have been present.  The flavor was dominated by a combination of smoky and coffee roasted malts.  It's a decent beer but I've had much better stouts."

It is also one available in bottles. Pours almost black with a thick tan head an good lacing. The aroma is a pleasant blend of roasted coffee, malt, and chocolate. Very rich and satisfying with a strong cocoa/coffee flavor. Malt, caramel and hops are all in there for good measure too. The finish is long and roasty. This is easily the best beer from the brewpub as far as I am concerned."

Easy to take down with no ill effects.I would wish this had secondary fermentation instead of carbonation for an even smoother texture, but its wonderful just as it is."

I liked the label and I had just had a Goose Island beer brewed for Trader Joes (the Black Toad Dark Ale)--perhaps the ""Island"" in the name made me think it would be as good, and the upgrade from a brown ale to an oatmeal stout would be an improvement.

Base beer for the Black Majic, apparently, and a nice one to try. First warm day of a Carolina spring and I want a roasty oatmeal stout? Eh, whatever. At any rate, I found it pleasant and unassuming. The nose is somewhat modest, decent roasted notes and a hint of creamy chocolate. Fizzy body is a bit of a surprise, given the style, and indeed its just a touch too thin for me. Nicely chalky finish, just like the coffee cousin. But the flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Id like it to be, even for a style made to session.

Poured deep ruddy brown with an explosive cap of deep tan head (Im talkin an inch of liquid and 5.5"" of head!).  The aroma picked up lightly-roasted semi-sweet chocolates, toasted oatmeal, and more charred black malts.. dusty overall with a bit of detergent character that detracted a bit.  The flavor had roasted sweeter chocolates and rolled oats with darker chocolates and coffee more toward the back.. coffee provided light-moderate bitterness, and carries through the short, but enjoyable finish.  Just a tad shy of medium-bodied with a creamy middle on the palate and nice balance.  This grew on me as the drink progressed."

Over carbonated, overflowed when I opened the bottle and could only get about an inch before it over foamed in the glass.  Aroma is mild with a scent of roasted malt.  Color is a deep black.  Taste is dry and toasted.  Starting with a medium body it goes down with a crisp roasted taste coming on and smooth feel.  Finish come is with a bright roasted flavor that turns to a bitter burnt taste and ends with a dry bitterness.  Even looking past the carbonation problem it still just isnt a good Oatmeal Stout."

A great balance of flavors going on too, nice malty notes with delicious citrus fruits dancing around. Not as strong as a Dreadnaught or 90min, but this has a lot of character to make up for it.

Barley Island Beastie Barrel Stout,91689,3228,6,Stout,4/5,7/10,3/5,7/10,14/20,1228521600,daknole,"Bottle from strykzone.  Thanks Dave.  Almost a black pour with a very small brown head.  Aroma is dark chocolate, molasses and maybe the faintest hints of bourbon.  Flavor is pretty roasty with notes of chocolate and a tiny hint of sourness. My only question is how long did they age this in bourbon barrels, 1 hour or 2 hours.  The bourbon flavor is so light and so faint you would never notice it if you didnt know what you were drinking. Still its a pretty good stout."

Smell is very roasted coffee and some chocolate. No hint of the bourbon barrel at all.	Taste is very much all coffee. Again, no trace of bourbon at all. This has a nice, huge and creamy mouthfeel thats very nice. Just cant get past that this isnt quite what was advertised on the bottle. If youre looking for a good, smooth, coffee stout then this is for you. If youre looking for a bourbon barrel aged stout, then you will be utterly disappointed.Earlier Rating: 1/18/2007 Total Score: 3.2Poured from a bomber into my delirium tremens tulip glass.	Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a slight 1/4"" head that recedes to a froth on top. Beer pours a little thin for my liking, but I can get by that.	Smell is bourbon and all bourbon. There are other smells fighting to make themselves present in the nose but the bourbon is just too dominant to let them show.	Tastes good. Theres a very good bourbon taste. There is some of the oatmeal stout coming through in the taste.	After letting it warm up a bit there is no change in the taste. Still dominated by the bourbon.	The mouthfeel is smooth with just a slight bit of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. I enjoy bourbon aged beers so I really enjoying this one. I just wish there was a secondary taste that showed up. If there was a noticeable chocolate or coffee taste then this would be a very solid stout.	This is a good stout. Appreciate the opportunity to drink it."

Pitch pour with a thick, rocky light brown head (delicious!).  Very light body but with perfectly strong carbonation and woody, (water-sucking) dry roast coming out on top.  A rich dark chocolate cake.  Bourbon is only coming in from the side, and Im not sure Id consider it a significant plus.  Delicious daily stout.Earlier Rating: 11/11/2006 Total Score: 3.8Bottle.

A frothy, dark khaki colored head settles slowly to a thin layer with a prominent edge.  Random spotting marks the glass.  Aromas include burnt caramel, chocolate fudge, mocha, vanilla, and faint hints of bourbon.  It is mostly sweet smelling, with traces of earthy hops lending just a hint of bitterness.  The bourbon is very subtle, almost unnoticeable at first, eventually folding into the brew quite nicely.  Flavors follow suit, sweet cocoa and scorched caramel leading the charge, with oaky vanilla, earthy spice, and traces of sour mash bourbon to follow.  The mouthfeel is medium-full and somewhat syrupy, its substance coming mostly from the sugar profile.  Still, it never gets cloying or overly sticky.  This is not a bad brew at all.  Its a pretty solid stout, although a bit too sweet perhaps, that has been subtly kissed by the oak bourbon barrel."

The color of the beer is nearly black and is has a small frothy tan-colored head.

This beer has a medium to medium-full body and is quite smooth with a bit of a creamy texture.  This particular bottle is much better than the first one I had.  That one was really bland and unexciting.  This one really has some barrel aged aromas and flavors as the vanilla and some slight bourbon notes are definitely noticeable.  This beer isnt stellar, but it is still quite tasty for being a barrel-aged oatmeal stout.  It is really well-balanced and although it might not be high in alcohol, it is still a good deal at only $4.49+tax per bomber!

Slight note of vanilla, wisp of bourbon, touch of oak.  Nothing intense.  Very subtle.  Stouts should not be subtle.  Especially bourbon barrel-aged ones.

Aroma is bourbon and coffee. Very strong bourbon aroma. Taste is like a Kentucky Breakfast Stout with a lot more coffee and a lot more bourbon. No subtelty here. Tasted more like a hard alcohol drink than a beer. ABV must be extraordinary. Not very drinkable due to huge ABV. If you love coffee and bourbon, this one is for you, but it certainly isnt for the feint of heart."

Pours a deep black colored body under a one inch brown head that gained density as it sat, ending in a tight bubbled foamy cream.  Aroma is very roasty with just the lightest accents of vanilla and bourbon.  Some chocolate fudgecake, and a little chalk.  The flavor is pretty thin with a mix of chalky roast, vanilla extract, and a light lactic tinge.  Very, very, light barrel influence.  Mouthfeel is on the thinner side with an almost nitrogenated carbonation feel to it.  A little bit of sweet stickiness on the finish.  Overall, just a little bit too thin all around, and lacking in complexity."

Pours black with ruby hues and an average size somewhat-lasting light-brown head. Aroma of bourbon (but thankfully not too much) along with chocolate, some roastness, oats and oak. The bourbons even more subtle in the flavour which is nice (thats how it should be!) along with sweet malt, chocolate, oak, some hops and a mild bitter finish. Medium bodied. This is bourbon barrel-aged done right, its not overpowering. I really enjoyed it."

So close to black its hard to tell the difference. A 1+ finger chocolate head formed on the pour that quickly faded to a whispy cap with thick edges. Leaves sticky thin drink lines with each sip that slowly fall back into the body. This beer looks good but menecing at the same time.		The aroma starts off with a solid base of malt. Coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate are both present and very enjoyable. A perfect blend of vanilla bean, some musty wood, and mild bourbon come in flashes over the malts. This is a wonderful warm smelling beer.		The flavor is all in the aroma. The chocolate maltiness starts things off and is quickly followed by coffee beans at mid-palate. The coffee beans follow through to the finish and are accompanied by lightly roasted grains. The vanilla and mild bourbon leave a very pleasant coating that lasts a few seconds after the swallow. Leaves a mildly bitter coffee aftertaste.		Medium body with a nice creaminess from the barrel aging. Sluggish carbonation lets the beer work through at its own pace. 		This is definately a highly drinkable beer. Very enjoyable and not heavy like most of the barrel aged stouts you run into. Lower abv lets you enjoy a few glasses without being too much.		This beer is a huge surprise. I saw the average score before I reviewed and after sampling this bottle I really cant understand why its so low. This is a wonderful beer. If its retired I hope they plan to bring it back at some point. Really well made beer.		Notes: I read through some other reviews after I wrote this one. Many said the bourbon was way too strong. I sat on this bottle for probably 4-5 months.		3/3/07"

Further Personal Perceptions:	-The fast-depleting head is barely noticed if you are staring into the deep darkness.	-The carbonation is rather frothy for the style, nearly recalling Belgian-style effervescence.	-Licorice and dark chocolate appear within the bourbon-made vanilla.

A nice dark chocolate-colored pour into our glasses reveals a very heady brew. The aroma obviously has bourbon and a chocolate nut bar. The oats are very much noticed. In the mouth bourbon is easily noticed, but it doesnt overwhelm or interrupt the other flavors of the stout. Rather, it melds well with the chocolate/coffee flavors not to mention the dense toasted oats. The finish reminds me of a Girl Scout Samoa cookie, just imagine it not being sweet. This makes a great sipper with a medium-heavy palate and very assertive flavors."

No sweet malt, no creamy oat-like notes, no hops.  Flavor is full bourbon.  Hints of peanut skins, salt, seltzer water and alcohol.  Pure bourbon, dry wood and light roast.  Its not that the bourbon is overdone here, its just that the beer is underdone.  No malt sugars, little if any chocolate or roast.  Body seems very filtered, though they say it is not.  Carbonation is omnipresent, sharp, obtrusive and very high.  Texture is watery, loose, prickly and thin on end.  As it warms, the aroma takes on a note of glue or hot plastic."

Since I cant, I will simply give a description of this version. Pours a nice black color with a foamy brown head. Seems very fizzy and carbonated. Nose is mainly bourbon with a slight bit of chocolate seeping through. Flavor is all bourbon, a little bit woody and some more bourbon. Lacking here, nothing good happening and the bourbon has taken this beer hostage. No solid stout characteristics remain and its like drinking a carbonated glass of watered down bourbon. BA is not always successful."

Ink black body with the most ridiculously oversized tan head (like Freds brother) that my have ever been seen by man or beast! I think. Well I know I let this beer cellar for too long by the secondary fermentation that took place in the bottle, hence the massive head (Freds brother) I have this problem with Shipyards Bluefin Stout. Its unfiltered, and once the beer warms to about 70F it starts a secondary and becomes over carbonated. 	 Nevertheless, the aging must have toned down the bourbon presence; although it is still dominate. The flavor has rounded very nicely. Massive notes of toasted oak, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon duhhhh! Downside the palate is feeble; thin and lacking punch.  If it were more full bodied this beer would rock the block, no doubt.  A great effort overall!"

The aroma has notes of mocha, oats, caramel,  smoke, dusty yeast, floral hops, and a hint of bourbon esters. The taste starts malty sweet with noticeable oat and chocolate overtones before leading towards a vanilla and oaky midesection. The finish is bitter mostly from dark malts and sublime hopping. The feel is quite lively and aggressive, a tad overcarbonated and thin. Needs more oatmeal for body. Overall, I liked it but could see how others may be disappointed. The barrel aging is upfront and the feel is weak. With some tweeking, this beer could rock. I have only the one bottle but would pick up another or two for a rerate and trade if I can find it."

Impressive lasting chocolate brown head on a dark chocolate brown body.  First whiff is watered down whiskey/bourbon.

Very smooth complex aroma IMHO!  Well balanced flavor with roasty & vanilla flavor; Chocolate & caramel  with resiny hop. Whiskey in the finish & aftertaste, but more subtle than the aroma.  finish is on the malty sweet side.  Minimal fruitiness.  Medium high carbonation...way too much for the type of beer that this is.  A little dry in the mouth, very thin, probably due to over carbonation.

Mellow aroma of vanilla, tar, cola, back licorice, and sharp bourbon. Moderate roastiness and moist soil notes. Fuzzy carbonation. Tannins add some firmness to the slick body. Soft cottony roastiness embraces the  delicate bourbon flavors. Brief earthy hop appearance at the heart of the brew. Rich toasted wood undertones couple with charred malts, adding even more firmness to the flavor. Bourbon is remarkably clean and perfumey, yet sweet enough to withstand the harsh malts and brighten the aforementioned subtleties of the whiskey. Gentle notes of vanilla and caramel cushion the vague acidity. Toasted wood and chalky black malts deepen the bourbon flavors in the finish with their resilient dryness. Delicate remnants of vanilla and black malt hulls on the tongue. This could benefit from a heartier aroma and more body/creamier carbonation.

With a little more balance between the sweet and roasted elements would have been appreciated.  Smoke comes in toward the finish to keep things interesting.

My first impression was that this is very reminiscent of the Dark Horse stouts- it pours very dark (but not so ""molassesy"" as Dark Horse stouts) with a large tan to light brown head.  Nice complexity in the aroma- licorice, toasty sweet malt, molasses, and bourbon.  Bourbon comes up big in the flavor too, with woody, vanilla notes that complement some sweet roast and licorice.

Aroma of super strong oak, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, licorice, nuts, caramel and a ton of alcohol - nice! Lightish-bodied, if that can be believed! Relatively thin mouthful with a lot of oak and bourbon at first with some mild malt, bitter nuts and a twang of vanilla at the end. Aftertaste is mild, some alcohol is noticeable, but mainly a light finish of bourbon and roasted malt - nice, since its not so strong! Overall, a very well done beer that showcases the flavours and doesnt get drowned out by the alcohol! The smaller sized bottle is another plus - perfect for the style, and this isnt even strong, so thats perfect. Id recommend this to others and will pick up the Porter the next time Im in Chicago. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, Illinois on 15-December-2008, sampled at home in Washington on 17-May-2010."

The nose is vanilla, chocolate and roast.  A bit sweet, but that might be the bourbon barrel vanilla as much as the beer.  Full creamy mouth, slightly higher than average carbonation.  Creamy and malty sweet.  Noticeable, but not dominating vanilla, ala bourbon.  Chocolate and roast backfill.  Fruity acidity in the finish.  Long lingering charcoal roast.  Perhaps the slightest hint of bourobn after the aftertaste.  Not bad.Earlier Rating: 4/17/2007 Total Score: 3.2Pours a dark dark brown with a thin tan head, thinning to nothing but a glass hugging  brown foam.  The nose is very boozy.  I know its just the barrel, but the nose makes me think alcohol.  Whiskey, a little wood, a little chocolate malt, floral hops, something green seems a bit off.  The mouthfeel is about average for the style, low carbonation and a hint of thickness, but not too chewy, not too fizzy.  The flavors are in line with the aroma, but the alcohol seems to come out a bit more.  I have a hard time believing the ABV is < 5.  Chocolate malt character over the whiskey slightly woody flavor.  The alcohol whiskey element is so sweet, a little hoppy, not much roast, but a little acidic.  Boozy finish, whiskey aftertaste.  The whiskey flavors balance the sweetness, but I find this to be a bit much."

Flavor is suggestive of those expensive Paradox barrel stouts. Notes of chocolate, wood, bourbon and vanilla. Whoops. I just figured out why barrel is in the name.

Nah.  But I did want to try this at GABF, but never got around to it with all the other good beers around.  Then a shining opportunity came when Schroppfy rated this and well he had a bottle for me to rate, score!  Well, this pours completely black and very thick.  The visible thickness of the beer is a welcomed surprise. The head is small but strong with a sticky thick lacing.  The head itself is a nice brown color.  The aroma has a lot of chocolate and strong wood alcohol essence but the alcohol is not too strong for the thick, lightly roasted stout-y aspects.  Also there is a thick cereal sweetness.  In the taste that wood alcohol essence grows, so it interferes with the other chocolate flavors.  However, the my favorite part is the mouthfeel on this brew. Its just so thick and lusciously velvety.  There is a reduced carbonation and it is tongue coating.  I feel like the Venoms alien symbiote is taking over my tongue.  This is probably the best BA low alcohol beer I have ever had, not much competition there though.

Pours black, with a thin-ish tan head that dissipates surprisingly quickly for a stout. Aroma of stale coffee (spent espresso grounds) some oak, and a bit of molasses. Very dry. At first, you think the stale coffee is going to steal the show, but after a second, you start to detect some sweeter undertones - the malts begin to show through the bitter front end. Its still very dry - some smokey meats coming through as well - but is far more pleasant than it first lets on.

Oh how I love coffee flavors in a stout. This one has a big roasty nose, rich toasted malts with a strong barrel presence to it as well. The pour is moderate, with a decent tan head and prickly carbonation. The bourbon tends to dominate a bit too much in the taste, overwhelming some of whats there in the solid base beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thin too. But its a decent brew that Im glad to have tried."

I think the berry mellows the bourbon in this case.  Palate is sticky.  Overall I think the bourbon is still too much but the blackberry has a way of mellowing it out which I liked.  It just didnt have anything for me to grab on to.  Different and worth a try none the less."

The coffee flavor in this beer seems just a little ""off"" while on the tongue but is dead on in the aftertaste.

A thin pin-dotted strain swirls around the head.

The taste is roasty malty, with a rich flavor of coffee and jalapeno oils...similar to Bells Java stout but perhaps not as smooth.  It gets a bit tarter as it warms.  Very unique."

Taste is roasted coffee in your face! Some good roasted/burnt coffee flavors going on here. Not getting alot of other flavors than the coffee. However, the coffee used seems to be decent so it works for me.	Mouthfeel is medium and pretty carbonated. Decent for a stout. This is a good java stout. Not over the top.

Although totally one dimensional, the coffee that dominates the aroma is really pleasant and smells quite fresh. Also noted are sweet and black malts, oats, a sugary component that just feels like sugar added to coffee. This nose is very pleasant, bold too, just so lopsided. Quite tasty. Roasty coffee pervades, followed by well balanced roasted grains in good quantity, mild chocolate and milder still vanilla to round things out. Finishes off dry and mildly roasty. The bitterness that lingers throughout keeps this beer balanced and makes it incredibly quaffable. Nicely surprising, a well done coffee beer."

Massive coffee aroma leaves no room for anything else. Its super concentrated...one of the most powerfully coffee smelling beers youll sniff. One dimendsional? You bet, but it smells good. The body is basically black with a few hints at a ruddy dark brown. The head is dimishing, mocha colored and starts about a thumb thick. Bitter/acidic coffee fore. Very dark coffee/dark chocolate in the fore. It then gets sweet with cream, milk chocolate and sweet malt through the middle. There are also bitter roast malt and coffee accents on into the finish and what may be a pretty healthy dose of hops or just the bitterness from the coffee. You like coffee? Then you cant dislike this. Again....fairly one dimensional, but fun to drink."

Extreme intense coffee smell which is so powerful thats really all I get.  Would have liked to maybe get something else out of it as well.  Taste is definitely coffee as well.  It was pretty light bodied which somewhat disappointed me, but I suppose its not an imperial stout.  It pretty much tastes like coffee with carbonation, which isnt a terrible thing, but I was hoping for at least a little complexity.  Definitely drinkable but has nothing on founders breakfast in my opinion."

The nose detects a lot of espresso, roasted and burnt malt, oat, chocolate, plum, a hint of pepper, and grassy hops.

What helps is an addition of fruity rind acidity and some hop character along with a dash of ashy yeast character. The finish is quite bitter and dry. The mouth feel is thinner than that of the regular Oatmeal stout for some reason, maybe the coffee bitterness gives a sense of thinness. It is very oily however.

It opens with a very coffee-grounds aroma, and the initial flavors reflect the same tendency to a crass understanding of ""coffee"".  Coffee is best when it balances, smoothens, and rounds out the flavors, not when it bonks your tongue with a sharp bitterness.  But then, Im a guy who tends to drink a cafe mocha--or at least a cup with a cream and a sugar--rather than a black coffee.  But like so many beers, my palate was deadened over time and by the end of the bottle it was more drinkable than it was initially.

While it carried with it a really inticing aroma of chocolate covered espresso beans,  treacle, and toffee, the flavor really was a let down.  It had a nice coffee/dark chocolate beginning and then, bam...nothing.  It just dropped off the palate in an instant and what was left reminded me of drinking a seltzer water.  A nice black hue, medium bodied with a one-finger thick tan head.  I think if the beer had more depth of flavor, it would score much higher with me.  Decent beer, but could have been much, much better."

The aroma picked up cold, dry-roasted coffee with just a touch of sour dark fruit that really worked for it.  The flavor was also coffee-focused with a more pronounced sour fruit and woody impression.. finished dry with coffee, toasted oats, and some residual sourness.. most likely a bit past its prime, but still enjoyable.

The oatmeal not only adds body to this stout but adds a nice smoothness.  The buttery flavor comes out especially well in the finish.  With the medium-to-low alcohol this beer sports you could tag this as a great session beer.  If I were to suggest any improvement it would be to add a touch more oatmeal to balance out the hop & java bean bitterness.

Vanilla, fresh beans, dry chocolate notes and tastefully light amounts of caramel collect at the edge of the nose.  Light hop bitterness invigorates the senses and pushes the coffee and malt flavors through to the finish.  Some crispy popcorn-like notes nearly remind of diacetyl, but I dont think there is any here.  Quite dry and with that papery, beany note that is inevitable in coffee stouts.  Hop resins persist on the end, but the smooth choco-vanilla malts do not peter out.  No alcohol noted, medium-high to high strength of aroma.Very soft, but high levels of carbonation lend a creamy-fluffy feel to the body, as light chocolate fudge braces the palate for a big dose of roasty coffee and strong vanilla flavors.  It slowly dries the palate, with help from hop bitterness and slightly astringent black malts.  Caramel sweetness perks up as it warms and breathes, and light looseness in the body is exposed as well.  No alcohol noted and quite drinkable.  Perhaps a little less caramel sweetness and more interplay between vinousness and coffee would help.  I dont see the need for this much pine and citrus bitterness either."

The appearance is very deep/muddy brown. Think  murky muddy waters. Much more brown than black but clearly darker than an IPA with alot of ""stuff"" going on in it and NO opacity to be found. Slight fading white head that leaves decent lacing. The initial aroma is mostly sweet citrus hops with faint sugar. The flavor is very smooth and sweet. Citrus and juicy fruit hops come through as well as dark malt and chocolate. The smoothness adds a nice milk chocolate accent that rounds this out nicely. The finish stays sweet and reminds me of a hopped up orange creamsicle with an alcohol punch. By far the most impressive offering Ive had at B.I. to date. Get it while you can!"

This has so much finesse its unreal. Im litterally blown away. The balance is utterly superb. NOTHING is even close to being overdone. I am really not used to this in US beers. As an Englishman, this is perfect. Vanilla, liquorice, some peat, earth, wow. This is brilliant. Huge yet cuddly and cute. Big bourbon finish but again its done SO WELL. Bloody excellent.

Orangey stream teams with green buds and dry bitterness.  Medium-bodied with curtailing pils malt and a lemon juice flavor shine on grapefruit rind shavings.

Moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		Tastes of sour citrus, earthy as well, the hops have a soft bitterness, toasted grain and a light caramel, nutty butter, towards the green pine needles come out, and a dryish, sour fruity, malty finish.		I looked at the website, but I have no idea what they mean by ""Tavern Style Pale Ale,"" I could see this being related to a 1930s APA recipe or a take on the English pale ale.

Another massively overcarbonated bottle of beer that despite the careful pour has yielded more head than actual beer.  Also, the nose is fairly soapy, which often seems to go hand-in-hand with the massive carbonation.  Anyway, after several minutes, the foamy, light-tan has died down to only a quarter-inch, so I can finally proceed.  Well, the flavor is also moderately soapy, but its mild enough that I can overlook it and focus on the other flavors.  Mildly sweet, fruity, and lightly malty initially, the finish shows some mild but balancing bitterness, as well as a light smokiness.  It tastes okay, I guess, certainly nothing special, but of course, that soapiness cant be ignored either.  Unfortunately, I cant smell much beyond the soapiness, maybe some sweet fruitiness and some floral hops.  Body is about medium, and despite the huge head, carbonation on the palate isnt expansive at all.  Dark amber in color and fairly cloudy with some small, dark specks settling to the bottom of the glass.  The head never fades below a thin but complete layer, and there is a significant amount of foam left on the glass.  Not a great introduction to this brewery, but Im hopeful some of the others will be better."

Poured a cloudy pale orangey, yellowish golden with a large frothy, foamy white head that slowly dissipates into a thin sudsy lacing, minimal amount of laced sticking. When I added the half slice of orange, this witbier acquires an even more orangey character.		Without the orange slice, had fruity, wheat malty aroma, lightly spicy, clove and coriander, slight herbal, with orange slice, wheat bready, orange fruity, spicy with a more pronounced clove, a light coriander, and the herbs are cut a bit.		Good, steady carbonation and a crisp, dry, silky smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel.		Without the orange slice, tart yeastiness, fruity wheat malts, lightly clove and coriander spiciness, a touch of hop spiciness, with orange slice, the yeast loses a little tartness while becoming earthy, the wheat malts dry out, become biscuity, the clove and coriander are more of a feature in the taste, a peppery spiciness, and dry, yeasty, bicuity, spicy finish. I prefer this with the half slice of orange, becomes a truer witbier when added, improves the taste.		Last spring when I took a vacation to Belgium and the Netherlands, I had plenty of witbiers served to me with slice(s) of orange, plus at some of the better brewpubs Ive been to, this practice was done there too, so I dont feel it is a ""crime"" or ""beer geek sin"" to add a little orange to your witbier, especially when that is the brewers design and intent."

For a Belgian style wheat ale, this beer tastes awfully sweet and has a very clear presence of clove.  The usual assortment of witbier flavors, the wheat, the coriander, the orange peel are all here, but lag behind the sweetness and the clove by a fair amount.  There is a slight bitterness extending the finish, helping to offset the sweetness.  The nose still shows plenty of clove, but is less sweet and more balanced, with funk and wheat having more interplay with the spices.  Light-medium bodied, gently carbonated, soft and easy on the palate.  Half an inch of white, tightly-knit head sits atop the hazy, light golden body.

Soft, very fluffy carbonation paired with a slick body. Gorgeous interplay between buttery chamomile and leathery yeast flavors. Swaths of sweet honeyed malts and, almost nutty, malt husks slice their way through the bold yeastiness. Coriander overexerts itself, lending more sweetness to the rich honeyed malt elements and masking much of the leafy hops aspects, rather than highlighting them. Tongue-coating oaty smoothness adds more body. Deliciously juicy, throughout, due to the fresh mandarin orange flavors. Finishes minimally spicy yet resoundingly floral and sweetly malty with a smattering of buttery chamomile and honey underneath. Phenolic belches complement the lingering honey flavors and lessen the sweetness, somewhat. Quite the fanciful witbier."

Vintage 2008, grey wax top.  Consumed when approximately 1.5 year of age.  Sent to me as a bonus by someone.  Thanks dude	The look: Cloudy ruby body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention	In long: Simple timid nose of dried dark fruits.  Taste is almost as restrained as the nose.  Dried dark fruits, candi sugar, toasted crusty bread, plums, dusty yeast.  All that turns into a disturbing burnt caramel a burnt fruits after-taste.  Overall this is not very tasty for such a strong ale.  Even the alcohol is nowhere to be found.  The beer is aiming for an Abt kind of flavor spectrum but mostly fails.  Not a bad beer, but not something I want to drink again or needed to drink once.  But they say beer can actually be good for you if on average people would drink 1 or 2 beer every week.  Thats good news, but some of us have to make up for the 2 billions of non-drinkers."

Pours a clear, dark, crimson-chestnut color with a quickly diminishing, smooth tan head. Sugary sheeting with micro-spots drips down the glass, but leaves no real lace. The aroma starts with a dark candy sugar base, with loads of fig and dark raisin. Theres a hint of earthy hoppiness and just a touch of dry cocoa that brings a nice balance, taming the sweetness. Flavors expand to show some burnt brown sugar and molasses, with a faint hint of smoke lurking deep within. Again, the cocoa roast and earth flavors keep things in check. The palate is medium-full, with balanced carbonation, though the finish is sugary and a bit acrid, with some alcoholic heat. Overall, its a solid, tasty Belgian strong with a nice nose, but the finish is a little over the top."

Aroma is fairly simple -  malt and molasses, with a hint of hoppiness almost buried by the sweet smells. Very nice. Flavor is dominated by malt with brown sugar,  a bit of sour molasses and a hint of fig. A lot of hops bitterness hits the tongue, but it is scarcely noticeable amid the surgery sweet onslaught, made more so by the very well disguised ethanol sweetness. Some sort of spice comes through in the finish  Allspice perhaps. Sorta like Cinnamon but not quite. The 10% ABV is a nice feature. Palate is thick and sweet   a brew to sip by the fire on a cool autumn  night. If you answer a personal add and hope to meet a SWF, but find its a Single White Friar  just ask for a brew.

Really remarkable clean, especially considering my past experience with Barley Island.  Creamy full mouthfeel, heavy, but not inappropriate.  The flavor is in line with the nose.  Perhaps better.  Big ass malt, very creamy.  Bubblegum.  Dark fruit, some chocolate.  Ridiculously sweet, but the malt is so round it works.  A bit of fruity Belgian yeastiness.  Lingering roast might be out of place given the Belgian yeastiness, but I just really like this beer a lot.  I may have overrated this... but it is drinking really great and I think this brewery need some encouragement to make more brews like this!"

The aroma has sweet brown sugar, creamy caramel, toffee, vanilla bean, heavy cream and Belgium maltiness.  Nice aroma.  Medium / full body with very gentle lightweight carbonation.  The flavor starts with the brown sugar aspect with a bit of sourness and anise.  There is some Belgium-like aspect in there, but it is more faint and the cream is gone.  The finish is fairly sharp with traits in the initial taste.  This is quite good and the best Ive had from the brewery.  As it warms a caramel / dark toffee aspect comes out quite a bit."

There is a sheet of head forming on the pour but is quickly gone afterwards. Smell is very dark ripe fruits. Too much plum and dark candy sugar.	Taste is even more of the unfavorable notes from the smell. Has a bit of a tobacco and burnt flavor to it. Whatever it is exactly is just way too dominant and overbearing. Almost tastes like they waxed the top of the bottle with no cap on it. Not enjoyable by any means.

This beer draws some parallels with Bells Hell Hath No Fury.  First taste is semi-sweet bakers chocolate, lightly burnt candi sugar, touch of banana but quite estery, light spices and some light dry chocolate cookie.

Taste is medium to full bodied, lightly carbonated, with flavors of multi-grain malt, banana esters, just a touch of cloves, candi sugar, a touch of plums, and a hint of dark berries. Finish has a slight metallic texture from its high alcohol presence with a semi-dry banana/yeast aftertaste that is quite refreshing. Uf Da! Lots of alcohol in this strong Belgian ale. Nicely done!"

A deep garnet body with a thin, tan head.  The aroma is really cool.  There is some vanilla, coconut and whiskey, all in very subtle states, atop a strong base that seems to be like a real porter.  Coffee, chocolate, slightly sour milk, and no strong roasted character.  There is a nice smooth, thickness to the beer that is not overbearing, but also not the consistency of motor oil.  The flavor shows more of the slight sour milk, the bitterness of the dark malts and the light sweetness of the residual sugars mixed with the barrel aging.  While not as good as the Oatmeal Stout, still quite enjoyable."

Sour dark fruits, some coffee, and more wood before this finishes very dry with a moderate, roasty, woody bitterness along with a good amount of vanilla-bourbon, coffee, and dry cocoa. Just a slight sour dark fruitiness in a lengthy aftertaste. Medium body and fairly high, lively carbonation. Overall, I initially thought this was infected, but it may be what they were going for. The sourness has more of a negative effect on the aroma than the flavor. The flavor is actually pretty solid with lots of dry roasts, vanilla-bourbon, and cocoa, but I cant get past the thought that this is infected. Either way, infected or not, this was okay, but Id like to try it without the attached sourness...if thats possible."

Dark khaki puffs laze about as if they too know what dark riches lurk below. Little lace to speak of, but her head lingers throughout our slow session together. Shy is not her middle name. Before I even have time to raise said glass to my nose, bourbon reaches out to grasp me in a cozy hug of tannins, vanillin, licorice, and bourbon. Breathing deep, I savor even more bourbon which is undercut by the most decadent of European chocolates. In the back of her nose is freshly charred wood reminiscent of a cooperage at work, barrels receiving their blessing of smoke and fire. Rising from the smoke and fire are mouthwatering cinders of sweet smoke, burnt sugars, and caramel. Yum! Shy isnt my middle name either, and I waste no time diving into her dark depths to make sweet love to bourbon, wood, and porter decadence. Rich, creamy, and silky smooth, she glides across my tastebuds like an angel descended. Melted chocolates ride atop a wave of licorice and vanilla, drying my palate with subtle ease. Lingering in her long finish is bourbon and vanilla-tinged warmth along with a touch of char. Each quaff continues to ooze bourbon while her porter namesake savors the show. Vanillin and tannin, bourbon and caramel, spice and warmth, licorice and char: my heart, body, and soul are truly rich.			Bourbon barrel-aged beers, how I love thee And though some may disagree, tasting the bourbon is most certainly not a detriment. The Beastie Barrel Porter from Barley Island Brewing was right up my alley-o-bliss from which I feel no desire to return any time soon.

Barley Island Beastie Barrel Porter,102023,3228,-,Porter,3/5,6/10,3/5,5/10,15/20,1280102400,Brigadier,12 oz bottle		Hiding in a mixed six pack in the cellar I pulled this out on a whim. The result was very disappointing given my expectations and the fact that it was aged on bourbon barrels. Honestly this beer would have been better if it had been released without any extra aging. Fortunately I only had the one bottle so I am not stuck with five more.		Aroma / Appearance - The thin feeble head was timid as if ashamed to be associated with the beer beneath. The color of weathered teak at least it did a good job of complementing the base which was on that thin line between deep brown and black. Cheap Hersheys chocolate coupled with a diet cherry soft drink and a scoop of vanilla ice cream give this a cheap feel. The oak is there but not with enough force to break through more than infrequently.		Flavor / Palate - Strong notes of roasted coffee kickstart the senses. The taste profile is otherwise on par with the aroma including an afterthought of bitter oak. The creamy mouthfeel is nice but when the heaviness continues into the finish it detracts from the rest of the experience. This is basically a one trick pony - dont be fooled by the label or the additional aging. I am sure Barley Island can do better though.

The problem is bourbon barrels impart a rather strong flavor and it takes a heck of a beer to stand up to that treatment. This particular beer is dark and nearly headless. A smack of tartness greets the nose initially and fades to a more vanilla-centric bourbon character. The flavor, too, is somewhat tart and cherry-like but really only mildly so. Again, the bourbon barrel character here is somewhat dominant w/ a bit of vanilla and some coconut. Whats missing I would say is much real porter character but, still, I would say this is much better than many other lighter barrel aged beers."

Appears a dark mahogany brown bordering black with a 3 finger tan head that slowly fades out. Spotty lacing is left behind.	Smell is slightly tart, with black grapes, raisins, roasted nuts, dust, and light American Oak, along with mild cocoa...wheres the bourbon I was hoping for???	Taste is of black grapes, raisins, nuts, and cocoa without anything complex going on. If I dig deeper, there are hints of cola and a touch of vanilla and caramel.	Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a light sweetness highlighted with vanilla cream, and cocoa sticking to the tongue. Semi-dry finish."

Aroma has LOTS of bourbon with some vanilla.  The body is medium / thin with lots and lots of fizzy carbonation.  The beginning flavor is roasty malts, but soon the carbonation wipes out the flavors and then there is bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and roasted malts.

A loud ""pffft"" and explosive head had me worried right out of the gate that I let this possibly infected beer age too long, but this is a very delicious beer.  Moderate roast and light chocolate are enhanced by a pleasant earthy and mushroom flavor early, but also by the wonderful, sweet bourbon character throughout.  I think the bourbon is done perfectly here; its prominent but not dominant and nowhere close to being overwhelming, allowing the roast and other malty flavors plenty of opportunity to express themselves.  A little more roastiness wouldnt hurt though.  The nose is less impressive though because the roast is quite light, and the pleasantness of the moderate bourbon aroma is offset by a slight smell of apple skins.  Body is medium-full and far less carbonated than I expected given the glassful of head I got on the pour.  Dark brown in color with all sorts of tan specs slowly settling to the bottom of the glass.  Each pour results in mostly a glass of head, so it takes several pours to finish this beer, and even on the final pour, the head is unrelenting.  Tan in color, becoming mountainous with peaks and valleys as it begins to slowly settle down to a centimeter in height.  Thick, chunky foam sticks to the glass.  Except for the annoying carbonation issues and the modest apple skin in the aroma and flavor, this is a very enjoyable and tasty bourbon beer."

Pours very pale yellow tih a fluffy and fizzy off-white head.  The aroma has sweet american style wheat graininess, a bit of spice, light paper aspects and some lemony citrus.  Medium / thin body that is smooth and pleasant with extra sharp carbonation on the finish.  The flavors start with some spice with some mellow wheat, grain, grassiness and light nectarine.  The finish has spicy hops and a bit of lemony citrus.    Nothing that will knock your socks off, but a nice light enjoyable summer beer."

Some lacing is evident. The aroma is light and wheaty. Light-bodied with equal parts hops and wheat in the flavor. This seems more like a light Lager than a Wheat. The finish is mildly hoppy.

This is something very special. Pours a dark mahogany color with a thick large dark beige head. The head retention is out of this world.

Very pronounced wine from the chardonnay barrels. In spite of all these complex and roudy flavors, this is surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. An astonishingly good beer.

On tap at the Crescent Moon beginning in December of 2009. I hope to enjoy this for a long time. This is actually a bit better than SN Celebration. Incredible pine and cedar and fresh cut grass to the aroma. Rich and deep scent that is simply a delight to inhale. The flavor is big for a single IPA. Lots of grapefruit citrus and green hop taste, but also has the malt sweetness to the body to pull all this off successfully. This IPA can totally hold its own against many of the California Big Boys. And for me, the carbon footprint is low! Zack has hit another home run with this one.

Fairly well made, although the taste reminded me a little of the pink filling in some of the chocolates you find in the assorted chocolate packs around Valentines Day.

A bit more than your basic lawnmower beer this is an assertive IPA. Its not quite up there with the best of the best but I can imagine regionally that it is one of the better choices.		Aroma / Appearance - Coppery brown with a dirty white head the body was what youd imagine a solid IPA to be. Aged cedar planks stand out in a mixture of hops and malt that is not quite the strongest West Coast but certainly in the ballpark. Actually it comes across as a bit tame.		Flavor / Palate - Heavy malt alerts the palate that this is not your average pale ale. Tasting like someone watered down planks of maple it transitions in the end to a resiny pine cone. The mouthfeel is thick enough to almost be cloying for the style but stops just short of the line. This was solid but doesnt make me want to put much effort into stocking up on more Nebraska pale ales.

Lucky Bucket IPA is robust in color, moving from dark amber to red.  My initial impression of the nose is that it gives a pretty solid aroma of piney hops, though it fades quickly.  Moderate amount of lacing and about a half finger of foam.  Sticky lacing continues down the glass.  Theres a hefty amount of bitterness and a nice piney bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy,  but it could use more body.  Theres light cereal sweetness is up front, with grapefruit and citrus in the middle, followed by those piney hops..  Obviously, this is a pine bomb.  The beer could benefit from some more malt sweetness, but overall I like it."

The flavor was a awesome and surprising burst of cherries, very tart, some sweetness comes through, wood, light lactic notes, very much a full flavored fruit sour (I realize it is also correctly viewed as a lambic). A low but lively body."

Poured a nice copper color with a nice level of head and carbonation. So far so good. 		The taste was sour, not terribly overwhelmingly sour but enough to question if I had gotten a bad bottle. I tried another bottle the following night -it was also bad. 		I contacted the brewery to ask about the off flavors. According to the brewery rep, sour is not an intended flavor in this beer! They offered to replace the six pack free of charge if I was in the area, and that they would like to investigate the problem. MN to NE is a little far to go for a sixer but the effort on the breweries part to correct the problem was promising. I did provide the bar code on the bottle so they could track the batch with their own records and hopefully determine what went wrong. Id like to try a fresh example someday."

I was very excited when I saw this one, just because you dont see many pre-pro lagers out there. Pours a gold with stiff white head. Nose is vegetal, cabbage and maize. Some faint herbal hop notes come through, but the DMS is a bit offputting. On tasting, its a bit cleaner, but still vegetal with maize being a driving component. Bitterness works but the hops that they are proud of seems really restrained. I dunno, maybe a bad batch?"

Ive learned that Pre-Pro beers were first to use corn as an adjunct, but this one is all malt. And the malt shows up in the nose and taste.

Malty nose but I also smell something akin to rotten fruit (very very faint), or could it be a Bret influence?.   There is a toasty malt flavor, almost dry flavor upon first taste.   Its almost smokey and a bit odd, although I can appreciate this unique twist.   Some citrus/lemon flavor (the hops?).   Doesnt really go together but separate it makes an interesting experience.  Given you dont drink flavors in silos I find this a bit of a confusing beer.   Upon further tasting, this really does seem to have a bit of a sour Bret side to it.

Clear amber with a small off-white head, fading to a film before long.  Aroma of some toasted malts and old citrus hops.  The flavor is fairly biscuity with a little caramel malts.  Some citrusy hops are around as well.    The finish is semi-dry with bitterness around a 3.  Light prickly carbonation with a light body.  For a pale lager, this isnt bad at all.  Also, not bad for a flagship beer.  If I lived in Omaha, though, Id pick most Boulevard beers over this as a go-to beer, for probably less money as well."

Aroma has a vinous quality to it which is most similar to port, but this scent is at its strongest when the beer is still.  When swirled, plenty of the roasted malt and booze rise to the forefront.  Aroma gets considerably sweeter with warming.  Taste contains similar components as the aroma, and the wine is more present here, although tasting it yields more of a dry red wine quality, rather than the sweet port present in the aroma.  Good amount of oak.  Roasted malt is present as well with some lighter dark fruit and maybe some dark chocolate.  Finish has a lingering amount of roasted malt with some hop bitterness.  Finish is a little rough actually, as the booze, bitterness, and roast coalesce into astringency.  Mouthfeel is medium to full with a touch too much carbonation.

The aroma is a bit stinky up front to be honest, sort of like dank hops but slinkier. There is also some cherry and apple with some light cinnamon and light wood with aa fair bit of Christmas cookie spice. The flavor is very woody with some burnt malt bitterness. The woodiness sort of dominates and is a bit brash but as the beer warms it gives way to notes of raisin, fruit, and over steeped chamomile tea. Interesting beer to say the least."

Further Personal Perceptions:	-A slice of foam tops the clear blond.	-Some wooden hops are felt in the background, but they are distant.	-The packaging and flavor profile are obvious knock-offs of Sleemans products, which is not really attractive...	-I know good lagers are few and far between in Canada, but that doesnt mean Id settle for this if I badly wanted a drinkable lager.

The aroma is quite nice, really, fresh chocolate-mint in mutual balance. Almost smells like a dinner mint, childhood memories of Andes surface! but it really doesnt smell too artificial or candylike at all. The mint is actually a welcome, fresh, and fun change of pace in the aroma because it smells festive and inviting. The body is a little thin, and the chocolate malts dont quite fill the palate or linger but the flavors are pretty good. The carbonation is lively. Thats nice but a little creaminess in the palate would really lift this up. There is more chocolate malt than mint in the flavors, leaving some nice roast on the palate. The mint just livens and brightens it up. Once you get over the bias against gimmick beer, its actually not bad and much better than expected. Worth trying for sure."

Taste is semi-sweet mandarin orange-like flavour not so sweet as to be classic soda pop-ish (the Orangina comment is bang on) with some grainy malt.  Fine, but strong carbonation.  Not great, but probably my favourite of the mixer in that it was at least a little different.  I have to say though if the Winter Mixer has a mandarin orange beer, a lime beer and a pale lager, what does the Summer Mixer have?"

A bit of malt on the nose. Aromas of mandarin orange and orange peel up front mixed with cutting-sharp chilled CO2 bubbles (stings the palate), and then finishes medium malty bitter - long and lingering bitterness. Viscosity is thinnish, low-medium complexity, low-medium length, low depth, and low carry. This beer is refreshing but it dies out fast in the mid and finish. I only enjoy the mandarin orange aroma, but one bottle is enough."

Beer appears to be amber brown as it sits in the unfortunate clear bottle. Aroma is interesting and surprisingly good.

Cereal type malts, and a very obvious but not over bearing canned mandarin flavor. Just got the flavour it almost a perfect mach to that Italian pop ""Orangina"" mixed with some beer.

The phenols come through in both the aroma and the flavor, which was also the case in other AP beers. The beer was cloudy, with a sporadic head. Cloudiness bears out the infection. Two of us split ~a 10 oz pour, and we could not finish it. On top of that, we were charged $12 for this minuscule pour. The claim is that this price is due to the high alcohol level, which is EXTREMELY unlikely.

UPDATE Got an email response from Tom. This batch was aged 8 months and came out to 16.5%. However, the next batch may not be. He will start brewing in 6 weeks and in 4-5 months, it will be ready and probably a different ABV. We can change it then). This was on at the Virginia Beer Festival yesterday (5-19-07) and the brewer, Tom, confirmed that this was actually 16.5% ABV in front myself, maniac and Cameron from Coastal Wine Connection. So I will be changing it after this review. Came out a thick muddy orange-rust color. Nose was powerful. Lots of spices, pumpkin pie, soft liquor and sweet malts. Maybe candied yams with marshmellows on them as well. Taste is bigger spice but its not overdone. Some soft alcohol, candy, sticky sugars and pumpkin pie. Body is medium-full to full.

Way too dark, and WAY to strong a roast character for the style. Strongly phenolic in aroma and flavor, which greatly overpowers any positive malt or hop character. Phenolic character most likely is from wild yeast infection, although in another beer the brewer claims it is from cloves. Why would anyone put cloves in a marzen? Pours clear, with a nice off-white head. I strongly doubt the claims of alcohol level. It is very likely 6-8 % at most."

I was kind of shocked to find that he is so anti ratebeer.com oh well, the guy could do well if he just accepted the fact that anything served to the public will be critized and talked about. Anyway this poured from the tap like you typical IPA orange look to it with a light orange head. Aroma is unfortunatley killed because of serving the beer in a chilled glass but I can pick up a light sweetness and hops. Let the beer warm for a good 15 minutes on purpose. Finally upon sip the beer was very sweet I thought for an IPA. Not bad at all just very sweet. The malts obviously went crazy in this brew and the hops seem to just barley balance it all out. However I will say that despite its sweetness it was very drinkable and actually damn good. All I could get out of the brewer is that he uses nothing but German hops which are less powerful than say Cascade or Chinook, ect. so that is why the beer is sweeter."

Beer is brewed by Howe Sound Brewing and is Howe Sound Pilsner Plunge under a sudonym.		Appearance: Orangey gold and slightly opaque, with a vibrant bubbly white head that quickly recedes to a gentle ring, but leaves lots of lacing.		Aroma: Not overpowering, but inviting. Subtle honey, and the kind of crisp hop aroma you can only get from a good quality pilsner.		Taste: Crisp and refreshing, with subtle honey and a big hop flavour. Lots of bitterness and some tart citrus flavours from the hops. This beer shows how both a honey lager and a pilsner should be made, unlike many others in the Pacific northwest. Pilsners in the PNW tend to be a little sweet for the style, but this beer from Howe Sound only has subtle sweetness from the honey, with no other unfortunate sweetness. It is very tempered with the hops, so the overall flavour is bitter, not sweet, with the honey adding complexity and flavour rather than rich sweetness. The finish is very long and bitter, only slightly dry, with hints of honey and subtle grassiness from the Saaz hops, and is intensely rewarding. One of the nicest pilsners anywhere in the world.		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and faintly silky from the honey.		Drinkability: Very moreish. Simply not possible to only have one of these exceptional pilsners."

A couple of batches were among the finest APAs Ive ever had.  Then that hop disappeared from the landscape and the beer became more of a standard-issue EPA similar to many others in the region.  Today, its a golden-amber ale with light bitterness, a faint papaya note, light maltiness, a hint of minerals.  Rather light overall, but with nice balance and complexity.  A subtle but enjoyable brew.  Of all the current Hagars brews, this seems to best evidence a shift from Gary Lohin to Howe Sound as it is crafted much the same as the HS beers."

Regardless, Bengal is the IPA that Howe Sound makes.  Unlike the Narwhal and ESB, its served cold from the keg.  Bright golden-amber colour.  Moderately hopped.

Rich brown sugar notes, depth of oily, maltiness.  Fruity, and warm.  This was the definitive vintage for this beer, and I hope Gary Lohin revives the recipe at his new brewery.  A 2000 vintage served 2 years old on cask was a little less complex, yeastier, and more mellow - I never had this one fresh so I won""t change my rating based on this."

Further Personal Perceptions:	-A sheet of foam sinks into the mahogany-laced dark brown.	-The aroma is too timid for the style; a little more age might have improved it, as I think this batch (at 7.2% abv) was served quite young.	-The fruitiness also develops grape-like flavors.	-Malts also become biscuity in the middle, diversifying the flavor profile.	-This is as well brewed as all Siboire beers. This brewer is very professional and I secretly wish the quality of his execution will inspire other brewers in the Sherbrooke area.	-For this Scotch Ale to stand out in its own category, I think it would have to have a slightly longer caramel malt finish, as well as a more inviting nose.

The fruity, alcoholic and sweet flavour profile clearly belongs to a scotch ale though. Thick-bodied, soft and creamy, remarkably velvety texture. Candy reminiscent nose, not unlike Qubecs Sucre dOrge. A texture beer really. A warming, soft and foamy presence in the mouth, concealing a earthy, slightly peaty malt base. Gentle cherry juiciness on top of red licorice complexifies the ensemble. Pleasant drinking - I love the mouthfeel."

Enough dry grassy noble hops to dry out the beer.  Body and carbonation are comfortable although a bit smooth for the style.  A solid brew from this newcomer in the Quebec brewpub scene.

A rather surprising appearance for a beer that claims its inspiration from the like of Westmalle Tripel, but the aroma feels more authentic than the clearness. The two most obvious aromas got to be honey and alcohol. They are backed by a firm cerealic pils malt base though, so the ensemble avoids the meady path that some less refined tripels take. Nicely warming. Fairly phenolic. Floral, very soft noble hops. A touch of peppery spiciness, maybe even a subtle coriander spicing - could also be grains of paradise is noticed. Id tend to think it was more of a yeast side-effect. The spicy feel enhances the otherwise overly smooth bitterness. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation for the style. A fine tripel, possibly my favourite from a Quebec brewpub."

A nice case of beauty in simplicity here. An english pale ale with no watery edges at all. Medium-full bodied even, yet with an engaging carbonation. Clean and tasty cerealic ale.

Slightly sulphury, heavily bready foundations still impart a medium-high sweetness level for a brewpubs most accessible beer. A fun mouthful of easy-drinking cereals."

In the glass its very pale, with very little carbonation. Its 8% abv, and this is well disguised. The taste is of apples and a slight peachyness. Quite sweet, mellowing out in the finish. Its a young cider and lacks body - it could do with a ageing before its sold. That said its very fruity and refreshing and Ill be buying it again. They also do a sweet and a medium dry.

After a while, as it warms a bit, there is a faint soapy metallic quality, but this is not noticeable if one drinks it cold or does not linger on it, instead letting the sharp herbally hops dominate.

A pale lager with very little bitterness, not much malt, and a thin mouth feel.  Pale golden lager with a small white head.  Best feature is a significant degree of floral hops.

Aroma is malt, grain and fruit, touch of corn as well. A medium bodied Pale lager. Malts are fruity and VERY sweet. Slightly spicy hops. Kinda sweet, kinda thin, kinda flat, and kind Cornish. Not terrible, but nothing above a cookie cutter Euro Pale Lager either. There is a sweetish aftertaste that is kind of objectionable. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is sweetish."

It pours a clear golden yellow color with a soapy white head and small amounts of lacing...the stereotypical fizzy yellow beer. Without a doubt we were horrified from the start by the green bottle. The aroma is malty, somewhat hoppy, with corn, wheat, grass and perhaps banana....strange. The flavor is light bodied and cloyingly sweet in the finish with a malty but heavily corny mixture taking over. Definitely not a very appealing beer, but I imagine itd be much worse. It does have its fair share of skunked qualities, but again, not as bad as expected. Low carbonation levels."

Cloudy, light orange appearance. Odd, tart flavor - hard to put my finger on it - similar to many Russian lagers I have had. Slightly fruity, slightly malty. Surprised to see this categorized as a Pilsener - too rough around the edges in my opinion with a bit of bitterness.

Dry, with a strong vanilla marking.  An odd residual bittering -- like green olives around the pit. (Not the vegetable quality, just the bitterness.) The brown-green bottle appears to be enough to combat the skunking -- since the '6-pack' that this came in was shrinkwrapped plastic -- although the bottle had a nasty ridge at the mouth, just where it ought to be nice and smooth.  Medium straw beer, clingy milkshake foam. Underwhelming."

Some light burgundy tresses when held to the light.  Off-white/beige head is initially retained at about one-finger, but rapidly fades to a ring, with fizzy carbonation running about in the liquid.  No lacing.Oxidation, DMS, soggy, nutty, stale malts, some light metallic character and plenty of pasteurization in the nose.  So thats nice.  Zippy bitterness on the end, but it almost seems more carbonic and artificially derived, not very hop-like.  Some soft brown sugar notes, rather putrid toffee/caramel and almost no yeast apparency, perhaps some acetyldehyde.  Well, that will be about enough of that.The flavor is somewhat oxidized, with a cardboard flavor.  Sickly sweet, almost syrupy, underattenuated malt sugars are simple and find no balance.  My friend mentioned the whole tea aspect, so its funny that other people saw that, and that certainly is a note I find in many dunkels.  This however, is just flawed on many levels, showing very poor lagering time.  Mouthfeel is fizzy, then watery (apart from the syrupy sweetness).  Some light yeast dryness on the end, but its a last ditch effort and quite failed.  No alcohol apparency.  To the drain with you."

Fizzy carbonation and a smooth without much crispness light bodied mouthfeel.

Finish is lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Ack!  The nose is ok, but it goes downhill from there, in the form of a bland and watery fluid.

Slightly hazy orange-gold pour with a short white head which leaves a moderate, geographic lace. Mild hop and malt nose. Medium-light body and moderate, fine carbonation.  Hope profile falls to the bitter side, with grapefruit and some pine. Malt is not very sweet or aromatic, being mostly rye toast and a touch of burnt caramel. I like my APAs to be lighter, more on the fruit, light toast and caramel side and very sessionable, so Im not a fan of this ale which is on the dark side and can be a bit of work. Still, its a solid ale from a promising craft brewer and many folks will appreciate it more than I do."

And the results are very average.  The flavor has a deep malt vein that runs underneath, which proves too much for the mild hops (mild, of course, being relative.)   The hops are apparent, piney with a hint of citrus, but the malts trounce any blossoming IPA-dom.  This beer would probably rate in the mid-3s as a APA.  As it is, blah.  So just ignore their signs and treat it as a regular Pale."

Nice red-tinged brown with a thin white head, and a good malty, nutty aroma.  Flavor was pretty good at first, when the glass was cold, but as it warmed, a bitter, completely unappealing strong yeastiness became apparent (This was the same flavor that has plagued some of my homebrews, in particular the batches that I brewed without using a secondary fementer, so the wort spent the entire fermentation on top of the spent yeast).  The initial flavor of this brown ale was quite nice, a smooth, lightly toasted sweet nuttiness, but all of that goodness suffered because of the off-flavors in this brew.  I plan on trying again and re-rating, but for now, I very unhappy."

Quite an accomplishment for a brown ale based just on her name. Fourth in my lineup of beers from Seven Bridges Grill & Brewery in Jacksonville, FL I hope she lives up to her name. A good brown ale is a pleasure all her own.		She comes to me a burnt copper with brown earthen tones where the light manages to shine through. A small head lingers on top, awaiting my eventual disturbance. Right away roasted malts and nuts (chestnuts), caramel, toffee, sweet raisins, chocolate, and cherries carry my senses away. A very promising start. Wasting no more time, I reach for my glass and savor the first quaff. A fuller body then some brown ales, she is replete with tons of bitter nuts right up front while chestnuts and bitter lemon esters follow-up. As I delve further into my glass, the lemon zest becomes more prominent, pushing some of the nuts to the background. Despite her fantastically varied nose, this is sadly about all that her body and palate come to. Not complex at all and unfortunately not able to live up to neither her name nor her nose, the Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale falls short.		Brown ales are great session beers. Full flavored with a rich body and highly quaffable, when I want a beer to enjoy a few of, brown ales are an easy choice. The Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale fails to live up to my expectations of a quality brown ale. She definitely had potential and I wouldnt drain-pour her, but there definitely could have been more complexity to her personality."

Wow, I was not excited to order this one, given my disdain for American wheat beers. The bartender wasnt sure which style this was. Upon receiving my weizen glass and taking a whiff, I was relieved. Very strong esters are evident in the nose with assertive Euro hops. Clove, banana, wood, bread are all evident here. This is thirst quenching and juicy, yet not too light by any means. I was actually surprised at how evident the hop character was. Wooden tones are apparent throughout the flavor, giving a pleasant acidic edge to the juicy banana and clove thing.

I read the name and didn't realize that the Imperial was part of the name of the beer and not the name of the style so I was expecting a big hoppy IPA. This isn't an IPA like I was expecting but more of an English-style pale ale. Sweet with a nice caramel maltiness. Not a bad session beer.

That is where the goodness ends.  The two words that best describe this beer are thin and bland.  Very little in the way of malt and not much in the way of hops either.  Tasted like a weak hop tea.

Pours nut brown, caramel with orange hints and a small frothy light tan head that leaves some lined spotty lacing.  Smoky toasted oat malt, kind of ashy, with some fruit hop notes (berries).  Smoky burnt ash starts to hide the  toasted oat but the smokiness comes through with a hint of bacon and a moderately acidic hop character.  It seems watery.  Medium bodied and crisp, clean palate.

Smell: The nose is reasonably diverse, though nothing about it is particularly bold, as it presents only modest notes of coffee, charred bread crusts, chocolate, and caramel.

Minor, predominately roasty bitterness. Light chocolate and coffee tones on the finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied (just barely). Medium carbonation (again, just barely).

And its actually made with espresso, not coffee, from a local coffee shop in Chattanooga. Looks black with just a little bit of light shining through, not completely opaque. Smell is of roasted espresso(coffee) and chocolate, hops are barely detectable. Taste has a lot of espresso in the front of it with chocolate and malty goodness going on. Really good taste. Lots of roasted qualities. Moutfeel is definitely thin for this, especially for a stout, but its not weightless, just needs some more body. Even though the mouthfeel is lacking, I drank about 6 of these in a night and could have had more. I love coffee stouts. So if you dont like coffee or espresso, stay away, but otherwise, this a good choice."

Pours black with caramel brown hints at the extreme edges of the beer where light begs to pass through.  Dark roasted coffee bean aroma hits you like a freshly roasted cup of coffee and then some sweet caramel malt notes pass by your nose long enough to doubt that coffee is the only ingredient.  Carbonated coffee flavor is well balanced with a caramel to toffee flavor and very low acidity.  Dark and thin, almost watery palate, silky smooth."

It actually took me a while to find this brew in the data base.  I almost reentered it under another name.  At any rate, this beer is supposedly brewed with coffee from the Stone Cup Roasting Company.  Pours a dark brown with minimal head, clear.  The aroma is nutty, malty, and heavy on the coffee/espresso notes.  The flavor is (duh) coffee!  Quite heavy on the coffee actually.  There is also what I will describe as a toffee-ish character but mostly a roasted malt presence and a light sweetness.  The body is light-medium but crisp, just like you might describe an iced coffee.  Really not a bad brew, but I found my self thinking that I could not drink too much of it."

It's not quite opaque but dark brown enough to look black at a casual glance. It has a nice light tan head. The flavor is nicely roasty with little to no chocolate or sweetness. There is a nice lingering coffee bitterness in finish. The coffee actually improves what is normally a fairly thin stout (it's based on the Big River Iron Horse Stout), but the coffee flavor is mild and seems to have used a more common morning coffee bean instead of a more flavor espresso bean."

This draft brew was enjoyed at the Big River Brewery in Chattanooga Tennessee which was hosted by a pleasant accomodating staff.  This brew poured a medium sized head of finely sized off-white colored bubbles that left behind a transparent uncarbonated red body and a fair lace.  The mouthfeel was smooth and tingly at the start and smooth and chewy at the finish.  It had a mild malt aroma and a red malt flavor.  I noted that it was an OK beer.

Pours dark copper with a frothy, though quickly disappearing white head. The aroma is fairly hoppy, but only in the way of Euro hops. Wood, hay, and an interesting fruity character are noted. The mouthfeel is medium. This is pretty crisp, but not overly vegetal or doughy like a lager may be. The fruit notes are more like berries and less like apples. Hops are approachable but assertive, given the style. This is a basic beer that reminds me of the cheap crap in cans at the grocery store, but without any of the flaws.

[April 27, 2008]		From a growler: This is a really good looking beer. Its near black and has a creamy, even, long lasting dark tan head. The aroma is inviting with plenty of oats, chocolate, and an almost smoky bittersweetness. Palate on this one is nice and creamy with very low carbonation.

Heres why:  over a decade ago, my friends and I would regularly visit Chattanooga, and would inevitable end up getting snockered at Big River off their house beer.  However, over the past few years as Ive become a horrendously unapologetic beer snob, Ive learned that pretty much everything I drank in my college years was utter crap.  So Im very, very pleased that Big Rivers Iron Horse Stout is so damn tasty after such a long interval between trips to this restaurant/brewery.  Sufficiently bitter and roasty with a smooth, chocolatey middle, this beer never gets mired in the metallic fruitiness that plagues so many smaller American stouts.  Plus, you get rich stout flavor without a daunting ABV, which is always welcome.  And I have no clue when it comes to beer-and-food pairings, but this stout was pretty good alongside my meatloaf."

Dark, seductive, sensual, as soft as a velveteen sky and as complex as the cosmos it blankets within. There are those who are afraid of the dark beers, but I say nay, there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Well, that and a bad beer; that is beyond scary at times. When my beer line-up was brought before me, the two beers my eyes and my tastebuds gravitated to immediately were the stout and the special brew, Belgian-style golden ale. I am saving the special brew for last, so instead I am faced with my dark beauty, the Iron Horse Stout.		An abyssal black-brown, there can be seen very little discernable light struggling through her depths. A thick khaki head fades to happy scattered puffs while lace decorates the sides of my glass. Right away my nose is greeted by espresso, bakers and dark chocolate, hints of cream, and lemon rind. Well played. I wait for no-one when it comes to my stouts, supping greedily upon her dark brew. Her body and mouthfeel is surprisingly thin with hints of lemon in her dry finish. Light notes of cream remind me of skim milk while chocolates, espresso, and sweet raisins play with my tastebuds. Her finish continues to dry my mouth with lingering esters of bakers chocolate and lemon. Simple and clean, the palate is there but the mouthfeel is a bit on the weak side which detracts somewhat from my enjoyment of the Iron Horse Stout.		Overall, she is not a bad stout. The Iron Horse Stout from Seven Bridges would be a great starter stout for those who wish to dabble in the dark brews without being scared away. She lacks the oomph, but has the spirit."

I had one beer and I dont even remember what it was so I have no way of knowing if they even brew it any more. Of course, I wasnt anywhere near the beer geek that I am now, so what purpose would it have served me then to go and taste beers when such a thing wasnt any part of my reality. Now is a totally different story though, and during my most recent trip to Jacksonville a few weeks ago, I made sure to make it to Seven Bridges and take a flight through their beers, tasting-pad in hand.By now we should all be well aware of my critical lager palate and unfortunate disdain for bad lagers. Ive had a few good lagers of various styles in the last couple years, but have yet to have any enjoyable light lager experience. So what should my first beer during my Seven Bridges flight be but their Southern Flyer Light Lager. Raising my tasting glass, I prepare to begin my journey of, ultimately, six different beers.My Southern Flyer was appropriately a very light dried hay color. There is absolutely no discernable head before and after a couple small swirls to stir things up a bit while at the same time releasing her trapped nose. Surprisingly, her nose is replete with lemon zest and fresh grassy hops. This could actually be a good portend of things to come. My first quaff is clean, crisp, and bright with lemon and summer grass which fades into a sweet toasted malt finish. Adding yet another dimension to this light lager is the addition of a light chewy mouthfeel reminiscent of chewing on a piece of hay or straw. Soft and delicate, cereal grains add a solid and lightly sweet backdrop to Southern Flyers prominent citric lemon and grassy palate. As far as sample glasses go, she was over almost as soon as she began, but I was pleasantly pleased with the Southern Flyer Light Lager. A clean finish with lingering faint grassy esters concludes my very first good light lager experience.I must say, this light lager had a more balanced body and colorful palate then some standard lagers I have tried. One thing about lagers and lighter beers is that it is nigh impossible to hide any mistake no matter how small. I would have to say that Seven Bridges has with their Southern Flyer the quintessential light lager which many only dream of accomplishing. A brew well done."

Hints of dark toast, toffee and bitter chocolate. Zingy hops give it an earthy, plant-like quality. Something in the sweet malts made me think of the candy coating on Boston Baked Beans."

The beer is a dark amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, copper-amber hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of citrusy Cascade like-hops backed up by sweet-tea like crystal malt.  The hop character is definitely dominant and has a touch of resinous character to it, but it really reminds me of ruby-red grapefruit juice and zest more than anything.		Fairly sweet tasting up front, with softer hop character than was in the aroma, but the finish takes a wrong turn some where and reminds me of stewed, oxidized crystal malt in a not so pleasant way; my second sip has this morphing into a dirty dish water like flavor that is backed by a piney, bitter hop note.  At the front of the tongue the hop character contributes a citrusy, grapefruit like and orange zest flavor along with some resinous pine and herbal hop notes.  The beer has a pretty good texture for this type of beer; if it wasnt for the off flavor in the finish, this would be quite quaffable with its medium light body.		Certainly an interesting beer, at times the dirty flavors towards the finish seem to disappear (but mostly it is way to distracting), but I cant say that I really like the heavier crystal malt direction.  In the end though the flavor can almost seems gross; it really does remind me of dirty dishwater, it is a shame as there might be a half-way decent beer here otherwise."

Back in the days of the cold war I was doing military service on the island. On new years eve about 20 or so of us had to stay while all the others went to celebrate with friends and family. Somehow one of the locals managed to conjure up about 40 liters of ""dricke"". We made a campfire on the beach looking out over a wintery Baltic sea and had one hell of a party. The evening ended with everyone not from the island (except me) being very sick. That is dricke for you, dangerous stuff!"

No carbonation yet it has very tiny sedimentation everywhere. The cider carries a very pleasant and sweet nose of MacIntosh apples and a white wine undertone. The flavour is extrordinary - a good balance of sweet, tart and alcohol with a spiciness to boot. A tad dry and thin for my liking but a very good cider all-round. Very enjoyable for a cider prices as agreeably as this one - $12.95. Would go nicely with a chicken or lamb dish."

The flavors are far too subdued, very little to comment on with the exception of a tiny grain finish.  The palate is seltzery with a thin body and overactive carbonation.

Pleasantly surprised to see something strongish on the tap list. A very dark copper, slight haze, small fine off-white layer of head. Rich gingerbread aroma, nice butter touch, a little hay. Flavor has a full Christmas pudding malt richness, ginger and cinnamon, some dried figs. The finish is surprisingly dry and clean, with just a little lingering grape skin. After a fairly long string modest and forgettable pints, this beer makes me very pleased. Extravagant and generous, rather than elegant or delicate. Just what I needed to fortify me for the long ride back South..."

Theres little aroma, malt, and only very slightly. Orange/brown in colour with a poor head, there is a pronounced haze, is this bottle-conditioned or is it a result of its age? Malt again on the palate, with citrus on the finish. Im not impressed...an unbalanced brew, perhaps I should try a fresher version."

Served in an Orval mini chalice.		Poured a moderate plum-brown color with a thick and foamy off-white head and some pretty good lacing on the way down.		The nose first brought forward quite a bit of brown-sugar-like sweetness without enough yeast character. Its clear from the start that this needed better attenuation. Mild caramel and a faint bit of dark fruit.		Body was too sweet and the finish too full.		On a side note, we had this again later in the week at the abbey cafe. That sample was too dry rather than too sweet, so there may be some inconsistencies at this point. Given that Chimay is brewing it, I imagine it could be recipe changes rather than brewing errors."

Dies down slowly and leaves a ton of lacing. Smells malty, yeasty, and a bit metallic. Taste is bitter and sweet. Dry. A bit of a yeast taste lending a pepper bite. Carbonic bite. A little more sweet than bitter in the back. Reminds me of Chimay Rouge."

Mont des Cats,147563,12,7.6,Belgian Ale,4/5,7/10,3/5,6/10,13/20,1314835200,Chad9976,"I received a 33cl bottle from a friend in Belgium (thanks Bart!). I poured it into a Trappist chalice.Appearance: Even without the yeast the body is extremely hazy, opaque shade of brick red and pumpkin orange. Forms a normal-sized, yellowish sudsy head which retains well but doesnt lace.Smell: Surprisingly weak nose with mostly floral/perfume-like fragrance and hints of dark fruit. Taste: Its difficult to pin down a definitive story about this beer as different sources on the Internet have different stories as to whether Mont des Cats Biere Trappiste is indeed a Trappist beer and if so, what style it falls under. The label seems to indicate its an amber ale, which I would agree with. It lacks the robustness and complexity of an Abbey Dubbel.The palate here is rather simple: light flavors of dark fruit up front with a sharp, almost sour sensation of tobacco and smoke on the second half and an aftertaste to match. Only light bitterness through the middle, with plenty of maltiness otherwise. That being said, this is still a mild beer overall. The flavors seem diluted. Not that theres anything off-putting about it, but it just doesnt seem like something youd expect from a Trappist monastery . Mouthfeel: The liquid is thin, but heavily carbonated. It foams up in the mouth and leaves a slightly sour, astringent aftertaste.Drinkability: If theres one thing the monks are good at - its hiding the alcohol and thats true of this brew, too. At 7.6% ABV there is zero alcohol presence in the nose, taste, or weight of the beer. The carbonation dances across the tongue and gets stuck in the throat. Not what I would consider a smooth beer until the end when it seems to become borderline watery.Overall, Mont des Cats Biere Trappiste is a decent beer to be sure, but not nearly as good as youd expect considering who its made by."

It is topped with a fizzy moderate sized head.  Head tapers off a bit but a bunch of frothy lacing remains.  There is a spicy fruitiness to the aroma but its faint.

A mild hazelnut sweetness mixes with a floral perfume and a hint vanilla for balance.  Malt and yeast are first on the palate with a sweetness that tastes more like caramel than anything on the nose. I also pick up some clove. Alcohol comes through stronger than I would have expected, but pleasant. No real hops to speak of.  This has a creamy carbonated feel.

Its rather fizzy, slightly murky, dark reddish brown.  It has a big light tan head that steadily dissipates to a thin ring and leaves only weak lace.  The aroma is yeast, orange peel, hints of clove and banana, almost like a blend of the aromas of barleywine, Duvel, and a German hefeweizen.  The taste is dry at first but then becomes rather sweet.  Its quite alcoholic from start to finish with a German dark hefeweizen quality along with prunes, dry 7-up, alcohol, whole wheat bread.  The finish is mostly of prunes, alcohol, and a soft hint of whole wheat bread.  It has some similarities to Bush de Noel, but clearly not as strong or pungent, etc.  Its ok, but I dont see much goind on her, its rather boring without being crisp, etc."

This pours a beautiful deep and hazy burgundy colour with a very full, thick and rocky off-white head that holds its weight rather well. Appealing dry fruity aromas are on the nose from the get-go, coming across nicely even through its colossal head. Once the dust has cleared (or head in this case) the apricot becomes decidedly more apparent with the hint of banana too. This is exceedingly smooth on the palate from beginning to end. The carbonation is apparent, but not excessive allowing its soft textures to be appreciated. The flavours are fruity -but not as dry as the aroma - with notes of toffee and the alcohol makes itself known but not in a bad way. It certainly went down a treat with me."

Chimay Red is a classic, flavorful Belgian that every beer drinker needs to try (several times if possible).

This is truly a great looking beer in the glass: deep red with the lacey white head.  There is a light touch of bitterness in the taste, but it does pour down smooth.  The only real drawback is that the flavor is a little thin.  After the blue, this is the second best Chimay beer.  Fantastic.  Cheers."

Im not wild about the design of the bottle & label, but the label at least is distinctive. The beer poured with a pretty nice, foamy head, but unfortunately a lot of it slopped over on to the bar. The thick body was a very dark reddish brown. The aroma was excellent: sweet, fruity, and yeasty, with (to my nose) a faint touch of apple. Taste was a richly complex sweet and sour mix, surpisingly mild but with just the right amount of hops to give it bite. It took some getting used to, but grew on me quickly. Its smooth, too, no foul tail at all. The palate was good also, a bit watery to start with but then you get a real tickle in the throat--and the nose, too. The kick is quite substantial, even in the small bottle, so be prepared. This is really a fine beer, though the price will probably keep me from getting it too often. Lovely stuff."

I had never had a beer before or since that was worse than that first Chimay Red. Now, ten years later, and a more ""sophisticated"" beer drinker, it was time to give it another shot. And the result.....its a pretty good beer. The aroma isnt much, as it is slightly fruity and yeasty. It is a great looking beer, as it poured a cloudy amber color with a nice off-white head. It has a nice full mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet with a nice caramel, brown sugar, and fruity flavor to it. Not one of my favorite beers, but a much better beer than I thought itd be."

This beer has a lot of different characteristics to like:  its lightly fruity, theres a bit of roastiness, and it is also a bit spicey (clove or coriander or both).  Easily the most complex of the three, and to me, the most likable.		Appearance is a nice red-brown, which is not quite opaque.  Head formation is decent, whitish, of uniformly sized bubbles, and sticks around an average amount of time.  Aroma is of dried fruit, and a bit of spice.  Flavor is more of the same, but adds a layer of light roastiness.  The fruitiness exists in a dried fruit sense, but also exerts itself as lightly sour (like sour cherries).  Mouthfeel was a bit astringent and drying, which youd expect from a beer with roasty and sour characteristics.  I really liked this beer.		Ive had this in restaurants before (all the Chimays seem like theyre popping in fine-dining places everywhere), and it is usually served much too cold.  This beer really seems to shine at about 50-55 degrees.		Definitely recommended."

It pours a murky brown liquid with some amber tones (and some ruby as it evolves) and many little yeast spots, with a gigantic consistent and pillowy beige head (tainted brown by a nice yeast sediment) that lasts beautifully throughout the beer and leaves some good lacing. The aroma is mostly malty, with caramel, brown sugar, some hints of banana and a slight citrusy hoppiness. There is also a good deal of roastiness and bready yeasts. It tastes kind of likewise, but intenser and more complex, some dried fruits suddenly appearing as well as a faint brandy-like touch. A nice spiciness is also there. It is medium sweet, a little sour and has a pleasant notable bitterness. In the mouth it feels thick and mildly carbonated, with little bubbles coming alive inside the mouth, very slightly prickling the tongue. The body is medium, giving the brew more drinkability. It finishes rather dry and bitter, with a sweet caramelly and nutty finish along with some floral and citrusy hoppiness. The presentation is smart and very trappist-like. I love it; cant help it. It might be somewhat overrated (not much, though), but the feelings towards some beers go beyond the metrics. A nice way to celebrate my 200 ratings."

Drank before the Chimay White so I could compare these two styles from the monastery. Poured a dark bronze colour, with a very foamy off-white head.

Fruity yeast notes of raisins on the nose.  Taste is all about the fruity yeast.  Prunes, raisins and grapes are the main fruity flavours.  The sweet malt-base feels more like maple sap than caramel.  Despite being very very fruity with grapes upfront the beer never gets vinous.  Fruity finish, a quick bitterness at the end is not enough to really pierce the fruity taste.  Very active carbonation with a little minerals touch.  Very good beer although this type of classic fruity Belgian ales is an over-crowded genre.  Classic.  My least favourite of the excellent Chimay line-up.  Always nice to go back to an old love as Orval and Chimay are two of the beers that turned me into good beers.  I was drinking Chimay back in the early 1990s.

Pours a nice burgundy colour with a large beige head, and lots of carbonation. Aromas are indistinct, but mostly yeasty, esterly. The flavour is nicely complex, very sweet, notes of caramalts for sure, some raisins, almost some bready malts in there which I did not expect at all! It gives way to a dull bite mid-palate, which to me seems like the only detectable presence of hops and alcohol. Very smooth on the palate, other than the finish, which is long. Some ripe, almost fresh tasting fruit flavours are evident in the finish and aftertaste, apricot, pear, as well as the added sugar and yeast. Not bad, my first Dubbel, I trying to get more into Belgians so this was a good experience for me."

App.:  Deep brownish-ruby, clear for now, rocky off-white head.	  	Aroma:  Huge gobs of brown sugar, caramel and treacle, lightly vinous with plenty of dark dried fruits, a moderate dose of yeast, a little burnt sugar and a bit of musty hops.	  	Palate:  Medium-full body, medium effervescence.	  	Flav.:  Light apricot, followed by a wave of malt-like flavours from the nose, a touch of cardboard and light hops; a little woody and alcoholic to finish; very restrained bitterness; feels almost refreshing.

Aroma is floral and citrusy with a touch of alcohol.   Rich cloudy redish brown color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly.   Flavour is well balanced with caramel malt dominating and the high alcohol showing slightly with the hop notes in the aftertaste.  Palate is rich with lively carbonation that sticks around as the beer warms.   Overall, a good beer-the best that ive had in Sweden so far.   This is my first Abbey Dubbel and if it is typical of the style, then i am looking forward to trying more.   I would have liked slightly more hop bite to balance the richness of the malt, but it worked all the same. (6,4,7,4,16)	Rerate: 33cl bottle.   Its been over two years, but Im finally getting around to rerating my first beer on the site.   Back then I had no idea what a dubbel was supposed to taste like, I just knew that I thought this was a pretty good beer and it sparked my interest in Belgian beer and the Trappists in particular.   I have certainly come along way since then, rating 22 other dubbels in the mean time.   I am certainly not as impresses with Rouge now as I was then, but it is still a decent beer.   The flavor seems a little too thin and devoid of malt character, with an almost washed-out yeast profile, but it still hangs on to a nice balance and some dried fruit flavors including apricot and prune, with a lightly spicy edge.   The aroma is a touch yeasty and doughy with some clove, cookie and cooked red apple, but lacks the depth and impact of better dubbels.   Light bodied and a little airy with carbonation that could be tighter and creamier.   If it sounds like Im just hating at this point, its only because I once built this beer up so much; I still dont dislike it, it just really isnt anything special once youve been around the block a few times."

Not that America doesnt have its fair share of scholars and appreciable achievements in the sciences (social science too), but we never see any Henry Higgins wandering the streets carousing with locals and berating their ignorance.  Somehow the tweed jacket seems forced, with pipes replaced by cigarettes and tea by coffee.  The Chimay Red is a drinkable vestige of this Old World cognoscenti, passionate and assertive, yet refined and reserved.  Its colored like a well-used redwood mantle piece cast in slivered sunlight, blanketed in dust, and crowned with a thick, spongy, heavy cream colored head.  Aged, odiferous cheese is the mainstay of the aroma, conjuring images of cheese served on ornate silver platters, smooth, salty but also pungent.  The distinctive smell of yeast adds to the fermentation theme, inciting a hunger for some bread, while a white grape note rounds out the savory flavors with a traditional and classic, wine-like character.  The Chimay Reds taste is abound with similar tried and true flavors, emanating a feel of traditional French cooking.  Before I notice any specific ingredients, however, Im struck by the smooth and creamy texture of the Red.  It is frothy and soft  a gratifying mouth feel, perfect for indoors or temperate weather drinking.  The flavors catch me by surprise as I relish in the palate, introducing themselves with solid doses of banana fosters, heavy cream, sweet orange liqueur and a generous proportion of alcohol.  Its warming to the touch, and a textural experience unlike any other.  The strong-willed flavors, especially the alcohol, make the Chimay Red a bold beverage, capable of holding its own even in the strongest culinary bouts, making it an ideal pairing for some heavier meals.  Root vegetable based stews, soups, pork roast and maybe even tender beef dishes, like a medium cooked Beef Wellington would all do well to meet the Chimay Red on equal terms on the tongue.  It is satisfying, fancy and assertive, and every bit a beer that gives me the feeling Im enjoying it in an intellectual parlor somewhere in a charming, urban European setting on a cool spring evening, although it would be of appreciable service in almost any environ."

Fruity, sweet aroma of plums, candy along with some earthy, dusty notes. The flavor is comfortably sweet as is the finish though some moderate bitterness slips in. Lively carbonation, watery texture. Served a little too cold, it improved as it warmed. Nonetheless, there are other dubbels that have more heft, more complexity and are more rewarding for the taste buds. Not that I would turn down a Rouge if it were offered."

This was the ninth and final beer that we tasted. It finished in fifth place in my rankings, but it was eighth place in the group rankings. Originally poured from a 750 mL bottle. The overwhelming winner of the night was t Smisje Dubbel, with Corsendonk Pater finishing a strong if distant second.		<P>Aroma features chocolate, vanilla, and soft candy. It is nice, but its too weak to score highly. Pours a very cloudy light brown with a lot of suspended particulate and short-lasting head. It definitely stood out visually from the rest of the beers that we tried that night. The taste is quite intriguing. It is somehow subtle and sharp simultaneously. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming in the taste. Subtle, good flavors overall. Medium in body. High carbonation Smooth, frothy, and lively in the palate. Chimay Rouge does not slap the drinker in the face with its aroma or flavors, but it is a good, quality beer that would stand up well to multiple tastings."

Pours a dark amber with a decent amount of head.  Let the beer sit a few minutes to let it breathe before consuming.  Nice aroma with hints of cinamon and orchard fruits.  This is the first Chimay Ive had and I loved every sip I took.  It tastes like a strong Leffe, with a sweet flowery taste, and a fruity aroma that stays with you until the last sip.  This beer isnt for everyone however.  It is very complex, and is not a beer one should be encouraged to chug.  Can be complimented with a hearty meal, or just had on its own.  Either way I loved it!"

Pours dark amber with some red hues, and a nice creamy off white head. Aroma of yeast, brown sugar, and dark fruits. Medium mouthfeel and very earthy mineral like texture.

Nose is decent and somewhat subdued for the style but does carry a Chimay character; notes of yeast, prune, light brown sugar, some apricot maybe, and touch a a typical Chimay herb character.  Flavor is similar being sweet with a touch of bitterness carrying mild notes of herbs; brown sugar is dominant with some yeast, a light toastiness, date, and some faint apple note.  Palate is not quite medium, almost lively, and with a nice smooth feel, almost silky.  Finishes with some bitterness and an herbal note with short sweetness of brown sugar.  Fairly well put together dubbel and remarkably drinkable.  Nice to drink, but just not to the incredibly high expectations of the other Chimay brews; lacks the great complexites but does enjoy the smooth, drinkability of the white and especially the blue."

Its good to know that when youve been kicked out of the local pubs, you can still drive over to Tesco for a few tasty treats. Thanks to my mates for shoving a few of these and a bag of krispy kremes in my hands and pointing me at the checkout. Is it odd that while I bought this, my Belgian friends had English brew? Right, the beer... Amber brown with off white head. Malts and dark fruit in the nose. Taste to match with the addition of peppery spices. Very well rounded and pleasant.

The white and blue are also good, but the palate of the red is delightful. Serve semi-chilled with a generous head, preferably in a wide goblet-style glass.

Neither were my type of beer.  I decided to try the Chimay, as it was recommended to me that if I didnt like the others I tried, I would probably like this one.  At first I did feel it tasted better than the other Belgium Ales I tried, but after awhile I realized that the aftertaste (which was a heavy amount of sweet/fruity overtones) was just not to my liking.  Since the Belgium Ales always seem to get high marks, I want to like them - but I guess my tastes go towards other types of beers (like a porter or a stout).  I am not saying this beer is bad, far from it.  It is just not the taste I am personally looking for."

Moderately sweet finish that lingers on my tongue.  I think this is a great beer, but I feel its a little too sweet for me (possibly because of the added sugar).

I personally love the sweet smell familiar to ales yet almost fruity presence. More carbonated than most ales Ive tried but the given carbonation enhances its qualities.

Billowing tower of soft foam settles slowly on a heavily steeped copper-tea, and leaves a nice tatting all round. Yeast sediment riding atop the creamy cap gives the appearance of cinnamon-sprinkled cappucino, and the quarter-inch of cream lasts all the way down. Nose is bitter yeast/nut/corn/hop/skunk. Extremely well-blended and difficult to isolate any dominant taste. Creamy palate is the best I have sampled, almost like a cask nitro. Definitely on the dry side, and hoppier than other Belgians I have sampled. Alcohol not evident at all.

Head is there but pretty much totally disappears.  Flavor is dried fruit and some sour apple.  I think one of the problems with this beer is the flavor is too thin for the carbonation level.  Maybe if the carbonation was toned down, the flavors would come out better.  Well, I had some the second day and this had improved after this flattened out. 	Original rating: 11.2 oz bottle.  Muddy orange brown body with small yeast particles floating throughout.  Light aromas of band aid, spice, and some dried fruits.  Rather large head quickly diminishes.  Light bodied.  Heavy on the carbonation with a dry finish.  This by no means is terrible, but this has to be the weakest out of the Chimay line (although I havent had the white or blue for a long time).

Aroma of Chimay-yeast and a very peculiar spicyness that I cant put my finger on, but I sure as hell dont like it. It is somewhere in between baby-food (the canned sludge) and stale puke - with a bit of goose liver thrown in. This smell got more and more pronounced as the beer warmed. Dark fruit in the background though, if you can believe it. Decent taste, a bit too soft/rounded for me - maybe too balanced. And ofcourse, the gooseliver babypuke notes didnt help much. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit like the aforementioned babyfood-sludge, stale puke and goose liver were thrown into a blender and mashed into a delicious smoothie. Not much carbonation, but hey, what would you expect from a goosepuke babyliver smoothie anyway?

Cloudy brown-red colour, large off-white head that falls away relatively quickly and leaves little to no lacing. A big aroma of sweetly sharp malts, caramel, multiple fruits like orange and spices.

Aroma is of spices, dark fruit possibly plums, yeast and a twinge of alcohol. I will say the aroma is really nice and this is a great beer to smell. The taste is nice with some spice and yeast.

Poured a dark ruby red.  The head was the dark side of tan, going to lace after first showing up substantially for a minute or two.		Smells quite floral, sweet and fruity.  I have to make the comparison to Hoegaarden... its similar in aroma.  As it warms, the alcoholic notes waft up a bit more.		Nicely carbonated.  Mouthfeel is good and average.  Nothing amiss.		Tastes a bit woodsy with definite high alcohol notes.  Tart initially, then bitter towards the finish.  The aftertaste is a pleasant sour.  As it warms, you get a bit of vanilla.		I quite like this.

As always, wonderful aroma: fruit, sugar, malt.  Amazing colour and appearance, large off-white head with a red/brown almost black body.  Chimay Red breaks down a bit in the flavour, though, I find its a bit confused over what it wants to be.  Malt is buried deep inside the mix, while fruit flavours fade in and out.  A good beer, not great.  Certainly nowhere near the best of the Trappists."

I had read some bad things about the ""mass market"" style that Chimay has taken, but as far as Im concerned its just a story, and the beer speaks for itself!  It pours a wonderful dark auburn brown, with golden molasses tones when held to light.  The head is thick, and lasts the whole glass through, leaving a very nice fine lacing.  The smell is sweet and crisp, with strong bread dough notes, yeast, and some fruit that is hard to place.  The taste is exquisite, and so balanced that its remarkable.  Its bold in all aspects, like a trappist should be, but no heavy alcohol taste or smell.  The aftertaste is exactly as it should be; a subdued version of the initial taste.  The balanced nature of the beer lets you pick out little subtleties in the aftertaste that make every sip another adventure, even after youve had it several times.  This beer is so solid, and so balanced, that it should be used as a benchmark to judge other trappist beers.  I know there are better trappist beers out there, but this is the best baseline Ive run across.  If you havent tried this beer yet, make it your next one!"

(Re-rate, 01/02/08) Some hops, earthy yeast and Trappist character, which is surprising. But too much stale cardboard. Gentle liquorice bitterness to finish. Thin and papery/ashy like Leffe.

Its quite full-bodied and slightly warming in the mouth, with flavors of dried fruits, ripe blue plums and sugars. Some caramel too, and its quite effervescent. Good bitterness in the finish, which else has the same flavors found initially. A really good beer that I find a bit hard to rate.

Even non craft beer Savants will appreciate a Chimay whether it is the Red White or Blue. Personally, I prefer the Blue and I would not call this beer (the Red) one of my favorites, there are so many other classy beers for celebratory occasions; but this one does have its time and place. 		Appearance: Served in my goblet the appearance is party translucent (but not transparent) amber / brown, with a decent head and nice lacing. 		Smell: The smell is sweet & malty with suggestions of caramel and plums. It also has some fruity characteristics and hints of yeast. 		Taste & Mouthfeel: This beer is very carbonated. It is sweet and bubbly in the mouth. The taste seems a bit straightforward and simple for a Dubbel. It is pleasant but not extremely exciting. Sweet malts and flavors of dark fruits and caramel sugars dominate the mouth. The hop notes are very subtle but present. It is very crisp. Maybe the high carbonation is partly responsible for the thinness in the taste. As it sits and warms the over carbonation fades and its best aspect seems to be the sweet aftertaste that lingers in your mouth for a very long time. Nice.		Drinkability: For a simple bubbly beer this is a great choice for graduation parties and anniversaries with a wide variety of drinkers. It is simple enough on the palate that few people will find it objectionable. It will successfully accompany a wide variety of food selections and it goes down very easily. So, like I said before, Chimay Premire (Red) does have its time and place.		Hope this is helpful.	Cheers!"

Mouthfeel was carbonated with a medium body. Dubbels are nice, but not that impressive anymore."

I love the brown-amber cloudiness, the burning/warming feel of 7% alcohol, and the sweetness that develops in the finish.  I can smell light toasted maltiness, red wine, and floral scents combined with heavier syrup and alcohol aromas.  For me, the flavor and mouthfeel lift this dubbel above its competitors.  I enjoy its soft to lively carbonation, medium to full body, and moderately alcoholic finish.  Chimay Reds sweetness and bitterness are in near-perfect balance."

You would expect that a bar this dedicated to beer and especially to trappist ales, would serve it a the right temperature. Too bad the bartender served it way to cold, so most of the aroma wasnt noticeable. Had to warm the glass up between my hands to bring it to temperature. Colour was ok, looking reddish brown with a hazy glow in it. When the aroma came back eventually, it had some forest fruits like berries, abricots and really fruity yeasts.

Great spicy, fruity, distinctly belgian aroma.  (I am pretty new to belgians, so I dont have a better way of describing it yet.)  I would assume Im getting some esters and cloves.  Flavor doesnt necessarily live up to what I expected out of the aroma.  Just doesnt seem to be all that complex.  Just a kind of bitter with a distinct belgian aftertaste, but doesnt seem to be a ton there.  A little yeasty and herby.  Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light.

Light melon and apricot to the nose, and the flavor is a bit lighter than I would have expected.  Does not contain the same round mouthfeel as the Blue Label, a bit more fizzy and ""light"" in comparison.  There are notes of caramel and fruit, sizzling from the front of the pull through the finish.  Hops, however insinuated, blend well into the brew.  I agree with some others (""alabamajohn"" below, for instance), this has a definite champagne mouthfeel - almost exactly the same.  It goes down well, without the complexity of its big brother.

Certainly an unusual aroma to this beer, somewhere between a malt cellar and a damp dog, though that isnt necessarily a bad thing. As for the taste, quite a deep earthy taste, lacking the bitter, fruity tang of some belgian beers; though again, this isnt a bad thing. Eminently drinkable with an almost caramelised aftertaste."

Tan, two finger frothy head diminishes to a tan film with pronounced center as carbonation comes up from the center in the Trappist glass.  A medium palate with a slightly oily texture with lively small carbonation.  Leaves a very full, even lacing that lingers for a moment before descending the walls of the glass.  Aroma is a slightly sweet spice with a nutty background  not terribly strong. Initial banana sweetness was a surprise, then goes into a profound choco-nut, autumn spices and clove linger to the finish.  Maybe cassis as well?  Has a very pleasant mild spicy bite to it. Barely a trace of bitterness to add balance.  A truly great beer.  Loved every second of it."

Thus commenced my happy journey down the hoppy highway through the bourgs of beer from Belgium. I sometimes like to decant it, others drink it all. Only because of the health benefits, mind you. The color is an intriguing dark. The head wasnt huge that I recall. The flavor was the same way, especially with the yeast. Gave it a bit of a nutty quality to contrast with the vineous malty character. Superb beer. An all-time fav. Too bad theyre jacking up the price so high that Bodega cant carry it anymore. Wahhh...."

Very dark reddish brown body with plenty of large, floating sediment. Color is very similar to the ""red"" color of the label, so close in fact that it must have been made that way purposefully. Average-sized to large, off-white head that is slow to dissipate. Not much lace. Initial mouthfeel tastes identically to the aroma. After a couple of sips I detected a delecatable buttery component. Wonderfully pleasant and balanced; my initial impression that this brew was pedestrian proved wrong; it is really nice. Not as carbonated a mouthfeel as a lot of Belgians. Nectar. This would be a great beer to replace the customary bottle of wine as a gift when attending a party."

Really attractive to look at with a perfectly formed creamy head and murky brown body, not unlike the Rochefort 6 consumed just hours prior. Nose shows aromas of settled malts and hints of sweet milk chocolate, as well as a definate pongy edge that might be more commonly found in a Flemish sour ale. Palate is also settled, very balanced and very friendly. Nice milky chocolate notes pop up again, together with a midly spicy but quite long finish. Easily the best Rouge Ive had from Chimay.		(9/05): Big fizzy headupon pouring but disappears almost immediately. Light brown with a red hue. Some cloudiness, quite appealing. Classic Belgium nose of cloves, heavy malts, some spice, although quite subtle. Palate IMHO disappoints and is not worthy of the Chimay monicker. Very subdued flavours, almost to the point of being dilutive, the only telling character being some enthusiastic carbonation.  Bad bottle? (2.5)"

Excellent lacing.  I miss the uncorking ceremony accompanying most good Belgians.  A light fruity aroma and subtle sweetness in the initial palate were a bit unexpected and differ a bit from other dubbels.  This variety is a tad less bold and complex.

Even though this is a wonderful beer, i must say Chimay Red is the one i least like from this brewery (ive also tried white and blue - a lot!). Beautiful reddish brown colour, a little cloudy, with a creamy beige head, that doesnt last long (at least for a trappist). The flavour is less complex than other Chimays and the taste includes impressions of malt, spices and oak. I prefer the flavour when the liquid is warmer. It seems more complex and tasteful. Conclusion: a very good Belgium Dubbel that reminds me how pleasurable is to drink an authentic trappist beer."

A happy, hazy beer smell wafts from the Trappist glass after its poured. Brown and hazy body with a surface skim of light foam, but no lacing. The smell lightens up once you put your nose in the glass. Taste includes impressions of brown sugar, rum, and a slight prune darkness. Despite the relatively light alcohol for this style, theres actually a kind of barley win maltiness to it. Works well as a casual summer drunking experience. And Jeezis Peet, Ive just checked off the Maple Trees beer menu: they still have a dozen beers I havent rated yet! Hmmm..."

Pours a cloudy reddish brown with no head except for a thin ring around my snifter.  Aroma is malty and nutty with dried fruit, spice and yeast with a bit of sourness in the foreground.  Flavor is of doughy malt and sweet fruit (dried cherries, peaches, and plums) and spice (corriander and allspice).  There is a pleasant Bretty sourness found in this beer that I think helps balance and round it out.  I getting a bit of hop bitternes but next to no flavor so I assuming they are using old hops as is usual with the lambic brewers.  Also some tannins are evident in the dry finish.  Body is medium-full with a good bit of carbonation.  Great beer, better than Bleu I think."

Lovely orange-red with tons of tiny sediment at the bottom of the bottle; monstrous, white, fizzy, frothy head thats easily recreated with some light swirling.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, alcohol, and apple/pear.  Flavor is more of the Belgian yeast with an excellently balanced and complementing light bitterness; slight pleasant pungency (the description says ""astringency""); light alcohol warmth and evaporation through the nose.  At first I felt this was too thin but as I drank it, it seemed to be come more full; TONS of carbonation, with the beer becoming just a bunch of bubbly froth in the mouth until the beer is allowed to sit and ""burn off"" some of it; slightly sticky after all.  Overall, this is not a knockout beer; what is impressive about it is the sheer craft of the beer; it wont knock you on your ass, but its impressive how subtle and how incredibly well balanced it is, how it all fits how and all aspects of the beer just work together.  I am looking forward to some of the ""heavier"" Trappists."

Hazy brown colour, big and lasting off-white head. Spicy complex aroma and flavour, some winey and woody notes too. The mouthfeel has still too much carbonation, but this is none the less a very fine beer. Im upping it a few points. Original rating: 330 ml bottle, at the White Horse at Parsons Green, London. Served in ""appropriate"" Chimay glass (whether those wide chalices really ARE the most appropriate for savouring complex beers, is a discussion of its own). Unfortunately served far too cold - youd think White Horse waiters knew better. For good measure, the waiter poured the beer along the side of the glass, which prevented the beer from ""opening up"", the head disappeared quickly and the beer kept too much carbonation. The beer has a brown colour, aroma of leather, balsamico vinegar and barnyard. Flavour is quite dry, well hopped, elements of leather and tobacco. Hints of cardamom and ginger. Aroma and flavour improves somewhat as the beer slowly warms up, but altogether this remains my least favourite of the Chimays  - give me a Bleu, please! Still a decent beer, but with the Trappists I expect more. Will re-rate when I personally control the temperature and the pour."

Well balanced, but is lightly to bitter.  Some roast comes through a little stronger than I remember it in this one and is almost coffee like.

The beer is well carbonated with a steady cascade of bubbles rising form the bottom of my glass.  The aroma is typical of the chime yeast with notes of bubblegum, alcohol, fruity notes of plum and raisin, some spicy notes of ginger, all-spice, and clove.  The fruity notes are definitely the dominant ones in the nose.		The taste is lightly sweet, with soft fruity notes of plum, raisin, fig and clove  up front.  The beer then moves to a sharp note that is a mix of carbonation, and yeast derived esters, as well as a bit of alcohol in the finish.  The beer is quite light on the palate, almost a bit too thin.  There is a certain level of astringency in the finish, which I have always found a bit distracting in beer brewed with the Chimay yeast strain.		Overall this is not a bad brew, certainly nothing to get really excited about, but it is a solid beer.  It really could use a boost in the malt intensity / body department though, it just seems a bit thin."

It had a fizzy fine-bubbled white head that had decent retention.		The aroma was very vinous (red wine / champagne) with some sour notes.		The flavor was strong pear and champagne with smaller notes of alcohol and a little sourness.  Some yeastiness and bitterness came out as it warmed.  The mouthfeel was pretty smooth, but a little fizzy.		Overall, I personally didnt care for the flavor at all (pear and champagne).  I really dont like champagne and this was way too similar for me.  It was pretty well made and did get a little better as it warmed, but I was already tuned into the flavors I didnt care for."

Unpleasantly aromatic with notes of bread, medicines, seawater, salt, green plants and dark fruits.		Dark fruits reside but the entire front and mid-palate is completely non-existant. The finish however is lovely, lingering and full of a malty sweetness. Once again though, my main problem, as with all the Chimay beers is the total lack of body. This beer still sucks but it blows away that awful Grande Reserve that they also produce."

Nose is malt, yeast, and alcohol notes, along with spice that is less sweet (cinnamon/allspice/clove) than spicy (oregano/basil/sage).

Aroma is malty and sweet with some caramel notes and some moderate spice. Some scents of yeast as well. Taste is nice! Malty and rich with more spice, yeast and some lighter caramel notes. Some dark fruit tastes in there as well, maybe plum or raisins. Everything is blended together well. Nicely balanced and filling. Mouthfeel has a fair amount of carbonation mixed with some spice. Finish is rather fruity and spicy. Another beer I cant believe I hadnt rated yet. Nice to revisit this one!"

It poured a big off while head with popping bubbles.  It was mostly diminishing.  At first the color in a full glass reminded me of plum wine, but slightly lighter and with a little orange.  Small bubbles rose from the bottom of the glass.  Initially, it felt lively on the tongue and released a flavor that is hard for me to describe.  After a short bit the liveliness died down allowing it to become smooth all the way through.  It had a nice full round mouth feel that was clean after the swallow.  The flavors started with what reminded me of warm doughy bread with a hint if nuts.  It ended with a pleasurable metallic astringency, which lightly remained in the after taste.  If drank quickly it has a sharp harshness that quickly builds up.  It is a very good beer that I will have again.  The reason for the lower aroma rating is because I have not been very successful in telling the difference between beers for a while."

Pours a very hazy copper with lots of sediment.  Nice off-white head with a good amount of retention.  Not much lacing.  Very malty and fruity tatste.  No hops in the taste like the smell indicated.  Slight alcohol taste, but for the most part covered up rather well.  Virtually no aftertaste.  Alcohol taste intensifies as you drink but never becomes overpowering.  Excellent beer.  Bleu gets the higher average rating, but I think this is much better. (8-4-8-4-17)		Bottle (33cL):  Well, its finally time for a re-rate.  The aroma is moderately fruity with raisins, grapes, faint apples, candi sugar, yeast, and light spiciness.  It pours a hazy reddish-orange with a moderate off-white head with decent retention.  The flavor starts with moderate fruitiness thats just like the aroma with a nice mixture of raisins, grapes, and faint apple.  There some slight candi sugar in the background.  The finish is somewhat spicy with some metallic notes that are somewhat iron-like.  Medium bodied with a nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  As the beer warmed the iron flavors began to disappear, but never disappeared completely.  My score probably wouldnt be all that much different than before if not for the iron-like flavors in the finish.(9-4-6-4-14)"

Promising aromas of candi sugar, spice (nutmeg/clove/anise), candied fruits, chocolate-covered raisins. Flavor is complex, but eludes an accurate description; the closest I can get is amber malts, dark rye bread, almost-chocolate, fig, mineral water, and a very light acidity. Some (noble?) hop bitterness rears its head and then fades away in the effervescent, fluffy mouthfeel. Finishes dry with an aftertaste that is vaguely chocolate, lightly peppery and nutmeggy, cocoa powder, and... fresh parsley? Tastier than blue or white label, in my opinion.

I first tried these beers in the Brugse Beertje in 1991 and liked them a lot.  The red, in particular, was strong and complex and I decided there and then that if this was Trappist beer I liked it.  However, recent tastings have left a bad taste in the mouth in more ways than one.  The colour is the same, but the aroma is wheaty and vegetal.  The body has vanished almost completely, with only a thin wheat, cardboard and chemically taste present, fading out quickly.  They say the recipe hasnt changed in years.  I dont believe them.

January 2, 2003 was a good day for bottling Chimay, because mine is wonderful. Poured out a hazy, rusty orange color.	The cork shot out of the bottle first. Very effervescent, highly carbonated. Huge head at first, mocha cream in color. Slowly slid back to a thick matting, and even more lacing down my Chimay chalice. Huge island of yeast floated in the middle of the beer.	Aromas are of caramel malts, lactic wheat tang, fresh cut hay, slight earthy & slightly musty aromas as well. I could go on describing this beer all day, because it is so complex, and so well made. Only 1 point off for cloudiness. Other than that, it was perfect. Tastes the same as it smells. Slight lactic wheat tang, enormous malty backbone supports the hops very well. Noble hops make an all too brief appearance towards the end. Bready, yeasty bite, and smooth mouthfeel make for a great beer.	I wish I lived down the road from this Abbey."

Aroma is mildly malty with some yeasty notes, but uninspiring.  Thin body yields simplistic flavours that disappoint.  The typical full, sweet, and fruity flavours that one expects in a Dubbel are only vaguely apparent, with more off-putting cardboard flavours in the background.  There has been a lot of controversy surrounding Chimay over the last few years concerning ingredients, recipes, and cost-cutting, but who knows where the truth lies?  Having enjoyed this many times in the past, I can only say that this is not the same beer that built Chimays worldwide reputation, nor the beer that will sustain it.  	Update (7/19/2004):  750ml bottle, aged 18 months.  The aroma and flavour have a much more pronounced dark fruitalmost vinouscharacter.  Slightly fuller mouthfeel.  Less of the cardboard taste.

The aroma is yeasty and quite malty. The flavor has a certain spiciness about it that is quite nice, also sweet malt and yeast come into play.  Body is medium and the carbonation, while quite lively in the glass, is not overly so on the tongue. Pre-RateBeer this and the Ommegang brews were about the only Belgian-style beers I ever drank. I quite surprised at how well this beer stands up to the many other Belgians I have had since joining RateBeer. It is not in the Westvleteren class of Trappist brews but it is still quite a beer. The gift pack that includes all three standard Chimay beers as well as a Chimay chalice is a steal."

So complex already; quite floral and fruity with a nip of alcohol on it, smells delicious. Pours thick copper with a creamy head that hangs around. The smooth silky texture of the beer brings obvious malt and fruit flavours, quite obviously apricot. Goes down with a bit of alcohol warmth and bitterness on the tongue, but nothing offensive at all. It's got quite a range of complexities to it, that I can't really put my finger on. Mainly sweet tropical fruits; like peach, apricot, bananas. More come as I get through it. It keeps you guessing, i'll try not to drink it too fast like the Blue. I'm very much liking this beer, not as much as the blue, but a more easy and different beer altogether. Cheers!"

The first time I had tasted this ale, it was during a night of drinking. I was pretty much pissed at the time and I didn't expect the brick that slammed into my face when I drank my glass. I called it a slow burn then, but hey, I was drunk, so what did I know?		I was ready to taste it properly this time, and so I did.		The Chmay Red poured a deep amber with lively rising columns of carbonation. The thick, creamy head rose like a cloud above my Chimay chalice. The beer looks wonderful.		A vague fruitiness layered with a more harsh smell that, although not exact, reminded me of nutmeg. The aroma was as powerful as I expected.		This was a different time and a different day so I was ready to be objective. No slow burn this time and no grimace. The flavor is spicy. the carbonatio heightens the bite of this beer and there's no hiding the alcoholic content, it packs a punch but with great flavor.

Smell is one complex mother of a dubble, quite unique, good smokeyness comes through with bacon and smoked dried oranges, sweet smokey malts, other dark but dullish fruit of plum and raisin, candied toffee notes and what I'm guessing is alot of wild yeast and a bit of cherry as well. Hard to get past the smokey sense, but it tames as it sits longer.		Taste is smooth and creamy delight of complexity, let this sit awhile after pouring, it seemed to ripen on the vine as it warmed a bit. Finally as I begin to reward my taste buds it starts with a touch of mint up front leading right into a punch of sweet malts, dulled oranges and dark fruits, mostly plum, a subtle touch of raisin, cherry, and toffee. The smokey sense from the smell is all but null and void. I was hoping it would maybe show up somewhere as it warmed, but nope. Towards the end it pick up some banana esters and good amounts of milding spice, clove, and yeast keeping this very smooth and quite full, a bit of a tingly-fluffy carbonation shows up late towards the finish.		Complexfully wonderful and a great sipper. Excellent yeasty surprise; smooth, creamy, tingly, spicey, fruity, nearly everything a good Belgian needs this has."

Smells like plum and alcohol.  Initial taste has cherry flavored notes which are highly pleasant.  Alcohol begins to come out immediately and does not overpower.  Body is medium and there is a round flavor on the palate throughout.  It warms very very nicely and many more plum, cherry and other fruit notes are apparent.  Ends with a nice yeasty alcohol taste, that leaves a bit more to be desired body wise (I finished mine very quickly) but other than this, no complaints.  Rerate, blind dubbel tasting.  I sure dont remember this one being this full and flavorful, but wow. My friend and I both picked this one as our favorite (and best of style) hands down.

Very strange meaty smell, like gelatine in a meatpastry, and arachide (peanut)oil or -butter. Metallic nose too, and after some time, dark malts and just a hint of hops. Very little bit metallic taste, then roasted malts, spicey - don't dare to say hops - and, definitely, salts. There is some salty whiff in this brew. Retronasal again meaty - and fruity notes, or preserved fruit. Rather light-bodied, certainly for its 7% ABV. Something velvety, however, on the tongue. The wheat 'flour' showing? I cannot follow people who praise this to heaven, nor those who will see nothing but a commercially denaturated product in this beer. An above average, reasonnable beer."

It is lightly hopped with a hint of banana. The head in my glass was small with fair lacing. I thought the body could have been more robust and found the palate a bit too lively.

The aroma is difficult to find, just a hint of earthy vanilla. This beer has a very finely balanced roller coaster ride of spiceyness and sweetness that strikes you in waves.

A mix of large and small bubbles which is indicative of low quality (with apologies to Trappist Ales Rule). Mild aroma with some slight estery yeast notes. Hazy reddish brown. Very sweet. Some candi sugar, bananas, and maybe some plumb. A sharp bite from the carbonation. Definitely a solid Belgian though not the best. Not as complex as I like to see in a dubbel but, in my opinion, superior to the Bleu."

So I picked up a bottle, half expecting that my ""matured"" palate would end up treating this as an also-ran, perhaps an ""accessible"" Trappist beer.  Accessible it may be, but even still, it's a damn fine beer!  The body is a beautiful hazy chestnut, topped by a small tan head.  The aroma is Belgian yeasty, medium sweet, malty, with just a slight hint of spice.  Tastewise, it's mildly sweet, yeasty, malty, and lightly spiced.  Very well-balanced.  It's got a big body -- definitely for sipping, not for gulping.  Even still, the mouthfeel is light, no doubt owing to the flood of carbonated bubbles that touch your tongue on contact."

The fact that it is unfiltered and unpasteurized is evident the minute you start to pour.

The alcohol monster sneaks up on crepe soled shoes to slap you around the head after a while - but by then you dont really care. The clove has lulled and numbed and whispered and you have either succumbed or complained. A strange and interesting brew. Take off your armour and let it seduce with its perfume. A warm and attractive beer that suffers from expectation. It aint the worlds best, but it is damn good. [3.4]	Nov, 2005 Yeasty fudge, varnish, paint and raw mushroom aroma with some burnt sugar and alcohol. Mostly chalky dry (yet sweet) with muddy spices, chocolate liquor,  some clove, a pleasant sudden sharp fruit just before the swallow, and lingering alcohol on the way down. Very late tobacco and toffee notes. Doesnt quite hold together. Light (almost thin) bodied, initially alcoholic and odd tasting, though with conditioning/aging the alcohol will mellow into a pleasant sweetness. [2.9]	May, 2006 Blind tasting:  Belgian aroma. Some chocolate. A touch of coffee. Yeasty. Bottle conditioned. Strong - 9%? Pleasant. Sweet, yet well attenuated / dry. [2.9]	May, 2011 This is a drinkable beer. It has pleasant parts, but doesnt exceed itself in any area. Hops are bittering rather than aromatic, and dont provide much interest other than a counterbalance to the sweetness. Palate is dry - chalky at times. Flavours are pleasant rather than exciting, interesting, special or unusual. Some yeasty notes. It is what it is, and its OK. [3.0] 	Nov, 2011 Part of the Nice Carrefour Belgian pack during the Nice-Cannes marathon week. I opened the bottle and allowed some of the carbonation to burn off during the night, but that still hasnt dramtically improved this beer. This is not really my cup of tea - the more I have it over the years the more I realise I dont really like it. Despite all the acclaim and interest, I dont think this a genuinely good quality beer. The ingredients are not top quality, and the beer, despite the evocative monestary connection, is made in a modern steel conical which reduces character. This might have been a great beer many years ago, before Chimay changed their production method, but today its a poor mix of poor quality ingredients including wheat starch, sugar and hop extract. I keep wanting to love it because of its history, but lets be honest here, this is a bad beer. [2.5]"

The Bleu is more complex, and quite possibly a more interesting beer to study.  I had this with a salad at the end of a very long day and found it delightful.  Nose is a classic European hop, floral and bitter, and some malt.  Appearance is cloudy, reddish copper, small head, white lace.  Taste is fruit, spice (banana and clove?  they say apricot, but I just did not get apricot!), and classic European hoppiness.  Good big mouthfeel.  Nice, solid, bitter finish.  Delightful.  I was surprised that I liked this more than the more famous and more highly regarded Bleu and Blanche."

This one, as most Chimay's are, was a gusher from the get-go. Orangey amber color with massive and i mean massive just off white tannish head which had subsided about halfway through the enjoyment. The aroma is beaming with orange and nectarie and well as some spicey clean qualities. The taste begins with a definite fruity undertone. Grapefruit, orange and nectarine dance through my head. The ending finishes very bitterly and very dry..probably about my only markdown...a bit too much of a bittering of the palate. Overall a beautiful looking and smelling beer (as always with Chimay), but an overwhelming bitterness quelches a nice fruit and malt laden beer."

Aroma is complex, funky and fruity.  Taste just does not live up to the aroma or the appearance.  The flavors are very subtle, and basically kind of boring.  There is some dark fruit, and some bitterness along with sweet malts... but nothing jumps out and grabs you.  This is my least favorite of the Chimay brews, and I only drink it if its given to me.  In fact, this is the worst trappist beer I have tried."

Spices in the nose, usual to belgian ales, but there is a rich sweetness that is not generally found in trippels or strong ales. Taste is a meld of light and dark fruits with spices, such as cloves.

Well, it's always available and might make for a decent convert beer for those who haven't tried Belgians.  Other than that?  While good, I honestly don't understand all the fuss about this dubbel.  Color is alright, but not a standout among the style.  Aroma is nice, but a little lacking, in my opinion.

And since I bought a gift pack containing all three and a chimay glass, I figure that I should finally give them all a rating.  The chimay red is the least alcohol but the most complex.  It pours with an amber/copper color and a perfect head.  Many flavors persist in this ale.  The malt is perfectly balanced with light spice and bitterness.  This ale glows as it warms.  A great beligan ale.  Re-rate:  So I rated this over four years ago and now I know - its good but not *that* good."

Lightly yeasty aroma, offering a complex array of figs, dates, musky cologne, tanins, and carob.  Solid Belgian malt profile, candy sugar and bananas, and some pepper.

You can tell its a belgian, but its like a light belgian without the massive notes of spices and malts, but more subdued and on par with a normal spiced up ale (if you can make sense of that).

This one was very very smooth and lusciously fruity and had no earth mustiness in the aroma or flavour. Even the yeast dregs tasted real good.  It reminded me very much of a slightly milder version of and I still prefer it over the blue.	Third rating: 8/24/2002: 3.9This time we rated two different  750 mL bottles, one was a use by 2002 and the other was use by 2004. Both were quite different to my previous 2 ratings (see below which were in 330 mL bottles). The 2002 750 bottle demonstrated the peat aroma and flavour that others have reported but I have not found in the 330s. The 2004 750 had no earth but strong cured meat, celery and chicken noodle soup character about it. The overall smoothness was also missing from both  750s compared to the 330s. Maybe storage is an issue here. Needs further research - a vertical rating even perhaps? 	Second rating: 8/9/2002: 4.3 Its good to have a beer like this right in the middle of rating a whole load of average stuff. It really helps you appreciate a good beer  like this and puts the rest in perspective. Everything in my original rating still stands - this is an excellent beer: Original rating: 22/6/02: 4.3 Faint hazy deep red-brown with large creamy tan lasting head. Very faint aromas when cold. When warmer, fruity hops, caramel, malt and light farmyard and doughy yeasts. Medium bodied and wonderfully smooth velvety well balanced bitter-sweet-alcohol palate from start to finish, some woody flavours in there as well. Lighter flavoured than both the Blue or White but still a great beer in its own right. I think I prefer it over both the Blue or White. Generally under rated and gains points because I could drink 3-4 of these at a sitting quite easily."

Straightforward flavors of white grape, cantaloupe, fig, and slick cherry-like malt.  Only the slightest hint of toastiness in the mostly hop/yeast finish.

Of corse that is expected of chimay having already had the blue and tan I knew this on would have to be great. It wasnt quite asa good as the blue but none the less great in itself.

Such complex yet refreshing flavors exist in this one.  Lots of fruitiness but it does not go overboard with the fruitiness.  the richness of the malt complements the fruit flavors wonderfully and the high carbonation keeps the flavors dancing on the tongue throughout the tasting experience.

I was a bit less impressed with this, however I feel that I need to try it again to do a fair comparison. Screw this comparison crap...how does it stand alone? Well, this was rather malty and nicely fruity. Like its blue labeled sibling this wonderful beer has undertones of currant and apricot but has an appealing maltiness that is all its own. (Im comparing and contrasting again arent I) I didnt catch the touch of bitterness described above, I actually thought this was incredibly smooth and was rather impressed with its lack of bitterness being so attractive to its overall flavor."

It has a substantial mouthfeel but also has a nice buoyancy to it.

I decided to retry it and found that I liked it a lot more this time around.  The prominent yeastiness was quite appealing and it had a lot more in common with Chimay Bleu than I remembered.  Used to be a 3.9, Im kicking it up some.		ORIGINAL RATING: This is my least favorite of the three chimays, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing!  Hints of nuts, slight fruitiness, and a little bit of a woody flavor make this a delightfully complex beer.  Maybe it was just the bottle I had, but the finish seemed a little off."

The balance of this beer is almost perfect.  Body is much lighter than its dark amber color would have you believe.  It is not as flavorful as either Chimay Bleu or White.  But its another enjoyable Trappist Ale.

Deep brick-red color, very much opaque and unfiltered (bottle swirled).  Balance is amazing in this beer, the profile is overall, malty, but there is a very nice, spicy hop bitterness that follows right along.  Flavor progression is very meandering and almost artistic.  Finish goes on for a day and a half, and it has a very intriguing orange-spice aftertaste.  Carbonation, head, and lace are all there.  Body is medium-full.  Excellent!"

Nose has that smell thats the same in the La Trappe beers; its like the taste of suger in the raw if you took away the sweetness. Maybe its from the sugar they use to start fermentation. Some very faint citric qualities to the smell with some other vague fruitiness. Im not sure how many people here have done this or have this weed, but chew on the bottom end of a stalk of Y grass (peel away the secondary leaves and chew on the white bottom). Its a flavor that very similar to one of those in this beer. Flavor it with a little bit of red grapes, minus the sweetness, with the faintest hint of alcohol and youve got the flavor nailed.

From the rich head (better than the White on this mark) and bruin color, to the balance of carbonation and flavors...gosh, what a beer.  The aroma is a bit softer than other top beers, and the flavor might be accused of not being the *most* complex, but this is wondrous beer in my book.  Re-rate (June 2003): a bit thinner than I remembered.  The aroma is attractive of pear and apple, and the caramel is decent, but it lacks a certain depth.

This brew pours a dark murky	hazel caramel.  The large frothy mostly diminishing head is off-white with virtually no	lacing.  The moderate nose is a complex mix of moderate grain, hay, caramel, grass, resin,	citrus, earth, raisin, vanilla, cola, and alcohol.  The flavor is balanced with a light start	featuring sweetness acidity, and bitterness.  The long finish is also balanced with	everything from the start being moderate with an addition of vanilla, caramel, anise,	pepper, and lemon/lime citrus tones.  The palate is the only glaring weak point in my	opinion.  The body is light to medium, the texture is dry, and the finish has a strong	astringency combined with a metallic texture.  The problem for me here is the excessive	carbonation that I can only compare to cheap champagne.  It really ruined the experience	for me.

I love this beer due to its drinkability as well as its pedigry and lineage.  It is more affordable and lighter than the Blue and as such offers better value for the serious drinker.  I still prefer the Blue as an ale to sit back and enjoy, but this is a really enjoyable, easy to drink, trappist ale with an interesing history.  Very nice."

It has the most earthy, yeasty character that I love in Chimays ales.  Dont get me wrong, I like them all.  And it does seem to be better in the large, corked bottle than the small capped one.

It starts more bitter than I like, and the taste is woody and reminiscent of rootbeer.  I do like the fruitiness, and the bitter finish doesnt linger, at least.

Flakes of suspended yeast (prior to yeast pour). Musty yeast aroma with honey, tropical fruit and some herby spiciness. Bubbly body at first with a good dose of coriander, ginger, yeast and light candied sugar. Watery body beneath the bubbles. Nice flavor just lacks malt depth. Adding the immense amount of yeast made this less palatable. Too yeasty and mushy for me in the end. Could use a lot of aging or maybe a pour without the 1/2 of yeast."

White head of foam, fading but with medium consistancy, some cloudiness (yeast in suspension, bottle had been laid down), dark amber color, little fizz.	Herby-malty taste, with volume, good foam in the mouth, some licorice, very good medium-intense herbaceous finish without bitterness nor stickyness.	This is very good, tastes like artisanal (as against industrail).  The lower third of the bottle was full of floating yeast cells, turned it into a creamy rich tasting ..food.. brew, very good indeed.  My score is no doubt conservative."

I find it the most complex on the palate and the most varied as it warms. It also offers one of these 'plus fours' ala Shulgin more often than any other beer for me. Unbeatable creamy mousse over an amber-brown chalice. A unique well-blended harmony of malt and hops -- perfume, tobacco, tart, alcohol pepper, creamy feel and very easy mild bitter finish."

I really noticed the aroma as I tasted it, an interesting complex smell I liked. I really noticed the complexity of the taste in the first couple of tastes. Im no expert so I cant tell what it was. But the more I drank, the less distinguished these flavors became. By the middle of the beer, it seemed like an decent ordinary beer. But I realized as I was finishing, this was tasty and interesting. All in all, a good beer but not the best Ive had."

New rating, despite the warnings that this beer is on the decline it still has very far to go before it declines even into the ""merely good"" range.

Will re-rate...someday.		330 ml into Chimay chalice. BB says 2013.	The pouring results in long-lived light tan head atop of hazy coppery fluid with reddish depth. Head slowly dies out until a thin soapy film is all what is left. Malty (not sweet!) aroma, unburnt toast, raisins, hint of plum and perfumy almost rose-like alcohol.The flavor profile is malty although far less sweet than expected - more alike of bitter caramel, with raisins, toasty bread crust bitterness and soft alcohol leading into dry finish. As with Chimay White the individual characteristics are somehow indecisive and I cant easily pinpoint at any although they are clearly delimited. However, the beer is very well balanced and refined with individual flavors/aromas in tune with each other. Medium bodied, medium carbonated. This dubbel is not nearly as fruity as that of Achel or Westmalle but it was the red friar that once introduced me into Trappist ale world and ignited my curiosity about other monastic brews, so Chimay Red , I owe you so much."

Fairly large, foamy, bubbly white head with average retention and a nice thin bubbly layer of lace.		S - Strong caramel and bready malt aroma. With a sweet toasted aroma and some nuttiness. Some light aroma of raisin and plum. Some spiced aroma is present too with cinnamon, some clove, and other spices. This is a bit lighter than what I expected, but it is nice none the less. A sweet, dark, toasted bread aroma.		T - Similar to the nose. A sweet, dark bready malt taste provides for the base and a lot of the flavor. Mid sip to the finish some fruitiness comes out with raisin and plum being the strongest with it being on the lighter side of a dark fruit flavor. Some spice, cinnamon and clove, along with a hint of bubblegum also come out. Like the aroma, it reminded me of a sweet dark bread with some pieces of fruit in it.		M - On the lighter side of medium body with average carbonation. A little watery, especially for the style, but pretty smooth.		D - Fairly complex and well balanced, but has a subtlety for the style in that it isnt overly powerful. All this makes for a pretty easy to drink beer. The flavor is good, but not strong or overpowering on the palate.		Notes: Vintage 2009. This was a bit lighter and subtler Dubbel. The flavors were enjoyable even though it didnt taste like other Dubbels I have had. Overall it was an enjoyable beer that I would gladly drink again. It didnt blow me away, but it was somewhat unique."

Big bubbles in the foam, and big bubbles settle on the bottom of the glass. Im drinking it from a large win glass, since thats the closest thing I have to a trappist glass. This is also my first trappist beer. 	Taste reminds me of Leffe Blonde, a fruity bubblegumy aroma which glides into a mix of almonds, marzipan and ... hm, what is that other stuff? I dont know, but I like it! 	update 2010-05-20: Im trying another bottle - this time an older one. Batch L09-648, best before end 2013. (The previous tasting was from a bottle from 2010, best before 2014). Its pretty much like the newer one in most aspects, but seems a bit more balanced to me. Its got a tiny sting to it, and and overall better balance between bitter and sweet. This leads me to think that this beer does well with a year or so on bottle before drinking it.

While there are certain standards and guidelines to assist one on their path of building a beer cellar, risk is always an enjoyable factor; the mystery and challenge of aging a beer to its peak of supping perfection. The reward is beyond words and the thrill is one of lifes best. Chimay is a premier Trappist brewery in Belgium, offering 3 sublime beers to the unworthy masses. First and foremost is their Premier, or Red, as it is sometimes referred to. Chimay themselves recommend enjoy Premier as fresh as possible; within a year, so it was a delightful surprise when popping the cork on my bottle at home to discover I was about to indulge on a vintage 2007 bottle. Glory days are here again.			Hazy ruby and blood-orange depths fill my glass thick and full. A bit hazier than usual, an attribute I would pin on her age. A gentle khaki head settles slowly into a puffy layer of foam which makes way for a succulent nose of sweet honey-glazed dessert breads soaked in rum and brandy. Plums, black grapes, red pears, red licorice, red apples, and ripe apricots bring a cornucopia of tropical and succulent fall fruits to life. Cinnamon sticks sprinkle spice unto her fruity bouquet while candied fruits and apple juice mingle atop moist rye bread and fruitcake. Her nose lacks a crisp bite but more than makes up for it in softness which has melded together in exquisite ripeness. Sufficiently impressed with her nose, those hazy luscious depths are calling my name; naturally I answer. Sweet, bready, rummy, fruity, spiced, and just darn tasty. Slightly mouthcoating, honey and maple esters stick to my lips and sides of cheeks while I bite into red apples, pears, plums, black grapes, and apricots, their skins bursting with a crunch, juices trailing down the sides of my mouth. Smackerific. Cinnamon sticks and rum soaked rye breads mingle together in each meaty quaff while the middle of her palate slowly dries mine. Not overly dry; just enough to induce my thirst and encourage further quaffing indulgence. Dry wood tickles the back of my throat while cinnamon, rum, and brandy spice my breath and warm my chest. Melting in her boozy warmth are all her juicy meaty fruity delights. Exquisitely rich, sweet, fruity, warm, and ending with a dry spiced flourish; I must say I enjoy her with some age a bit more than fresh, though for a totally different set of reasons.			Chimay never fails to please and sometimes even surprise. While I wouldnt age the Premier as long as I would their Grand Reserve, by all means bring home a few bottles. Enjoy one fresh, but then save the others for later supping in whatever randomly timed intervals you so please."

It has a smooth and dry finish with some hints of brown sugar and rum. Theres a slightly bitter clove aftertaste. Smooth and tasty with a relatively low ABV for a Belgian."

Interesting, well-done and quality stuff but a little bland: very discreet sweetness, discreet fruityness, discreet bitterness.  This still produces a largely-over-the-decent-mark brew but I much prefered the complexity and depth of taste of Westmalle Dubbel in 75cl bottle."

Perfect red and orange color and thin head resting in a wide brimmed glass. The aroma was sweet and yeasty. Sort of dried apricot and white peach along with a little spice and bread from the yeast esters. Such a silky mouth feel along with the sweetness makes ones feel as if he is drinking a perfume. Ends in a slightest bitter finish.

The aroma is rich and musty with redcurrants and salty crackers.  In the mouth there is a burst of rich sweetness which then turns to more roasty characters and a sticky caramel yeastiness. 		I drank this alongside the Ham Cooked in Coke and Stout from Appetite for Ale and it was excellent bringing a frutiness to cut through the fatty pork.  I found the sweet glaze gave it a touch too much of a bitterness in the finish though. Maybe there is a better dish to pair with (though they recommended it in the book.)

Head disappears quickly, leaving no lacing.  Smell is of caramel, red wine grapes and apricot.   Mouthfeel is medium to thick but somewhat light and smooth as well.

Like most dubbels, its malty and full-bodied, but unlike most of them it has a particularly yeasty flavor. Taste is of brown sugar, as brown as the brew itself when it hits the glass. A moderate, off-white topping gives of a faint scent of clove. This is a very nice beer; light enough to go with most foods or to be drunk rather easily, beefy enough to weigh in with the pros."

Ive never had to put a wine snob in their place, but if I did Id probably use the entire Chimay line (and all the authentic trappist beers for that matter) as an example of beer craftsmanship.Chimay Red Premiere is a great starter beer for the wine-drinker looking for a comparable beer. Its got all the makings of a versatile red wine: strong aroma and palate, fruity taste without the bitterness, and the body to match. Pedestrian drinkers might find it a bit intimidating, but in reality its actually not as uppity as one might assume.Chimay beers are sold in either 330ml capped or crowned bottles or 750ml corked bottles, and there is a distinct difference between the two. I was able to drink both versions but found the corked beer to be a bit superior. Ill discuss the differences throughout this review as applicable.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAIf poured from a 750ml bottle, there is quite a lot of kickback (which is due to the shape of the bottle and is completely normal). Out of a stubby, reverse funnel-shaped 330ml bottle, the beer pours much smoother.The body is a dark, murky shade of maroon or rusty brown, almost like iced tea. There is noticeable sediment due to the fact this is a bottle-conditioned beer which means the yeast is still at work even after the brewing process. If poured into an official Chimay glass (or a red wine glass or similar glass), the beer produces a fairly small layer of off-white, foamy head. It lingers for quite a while but will eventually disappear completely and leave no lacing.I noticed two different aromas. The corked bottle is much lighter in the nose with a sweet, fruity, malty scent. It indicates a lively palate. The crowned bottle is reminiscent of red wine with a sour, dry nose. The presence of alcohol is well-concealed by both versions.TASTEUpon my first taste of Chimay Red I was immediately reminded of a German-style doppelbock. Considering that this is a Belgian dubbel, it isnt surprising the styles are so similar (even though one is a lager and one is an ale).In the case of the 750ml corked bottle, the beer has a rich, malty character complimented by the taste of dark fruits (i.e. plum, raisin, fig). The taste is sweeter than I was expecting, almost sugary. The backend is slightly dry but the alcohol is never noticeable. Its tasty, to be sure, but its surprisingly mild.With the 330ml capped bottle I was immediately reminded of a red wine as soon as it hit my tongue. This version is drier and rather sour with a distinct grape-like taste. Interestingly, the finish is even sweeter with a candy apple-like taste. I dont think caramel malts are used in this beer but I did notice a caramel-like sweetness on the finish, although it dries out rather quickly. The taste is a little more intense here, but it seems more to-the-point whereas the corked version takes a roundabout path.FINISHBottle-conditioned beers tend to be more highly carbonated than other brews. The corked edition of Chimay Red has a slightly flat, thin, watery mouthfeel. There is definitely carbonation action present, but its a completely different type compared to that found in a macro lager. It goes down extremely smooth and is not a challenge to drink whatsoever.With the smaller bottle the finish was more or less the same, but with a seemingly more intense mouthfeel. The finish, while sweet, also leaves a dry, almost sour aftertaste and warms as it goes down. Its just about as smooth as its big brother, and certainly easier to drink than red wine.BODYI probably wouldnt consider a beer with an alcohol content of 7% ABV to be a big beer, although I think Chimays reputation might supersede its actual potency. In other words, Red Premiere drinks like a heavy beer because we assume it is one. This is ironic because the beer does not have a boozy taste to it unless allowed to warm to near room temperature. The drinker is unlikely to immediately feel the effects of the alcohol, but it will make its presence known in the end.FINAL THOUGHTSThe Chimay beers are roundly regarded as some of the best brews on the planet and for a beer critic to rate them at anything less than the best is probably consider blasphemy. While I would say I really enjoyed both versions of the beer I cant quite rate either versions among the best of the best. Despite the fact the palate to both beers is not as intense as one might expect, Id still consider Chimay Red Premiere to be an acquired taste. I highly recommend trying it, if only to see how well a beer can work as a wine substitute.NOTE: Watch the video versions of this review here:750ml corked version:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba0G5lg_bY4330ml capped version:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbc_BZXr-Hw"

Carbonation seems really active, but the head doesnt last; nice lacing.  Sweet, malty aroma with raisins taking the forefront; dates, red apples, pear, red grapes, slight spice.  Very similar in the taste: apples and grapes make up the primary flavor for me.  Bready malts are evident with clove and other spices coming through.  Finishes with brown sugar, spice, and a slight boozy touch.  Medium bodied with a frothy mouthfeel and a medium level of carbonation.  Despite being a bit thin, I feel the rating is appropriate mostly in part to its impeccable balance.  The tastes all compliment each other very well with nothing standing out too much or too little.  This leads to a very easy to drink, great brew."

Rich mahogany hue with short lasting brindle (tan with flecks of various browns) foamy head fully diminishing, murky body with a thick density of medium sized particles. Moderate to heavy malty aromas - caramel, Maltexo, toffee, bread, with a plethora of complex fruity and spicy aromas - vinous, stone-fruit, banana, cloves, and some yeasty aromas - dough. Taste is heavy sweet, some mild bitterness makes a brief appearance then the sweetness dominates again with a long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily almost syrupy, carbonation is mostly lively leaving a tingly tongue, pleasant warming alcoholic finish. 	This was a really nice beer but may have suffered from high (97th percentile) expectations. Didnt quite live up to the hype for me. Still very enjoyable though."

Lots of yeast with a light spice and some vinous characteristics. There is a good deal of citric fruits, apricots, grapes, and some raisin. Flavor is similar, not quite as nice as the aroma in my opinion.  Some thinner caramels and a little more noticeable toffee flavor.

The earthy Mineral like character was one of the first real flavors that I identified in a beer years ago and its been a real love hate thing ever since, but the mineral qualities in this beer only add to the depth and complexity of this ale and I dare say this for me sets this beer apart from many in its style.

M: Medium-bodied with a creamy texture, and a quite fizzy carbonation.		D: Wow, this is an excellent Dubbel. Definitely goes down easy with hardly any trace of alcohol. Something I could sip on all night if I had the opportunity."

It also had a slight golden tint to it. The beer itself is pretty opaque and formed a pretty minimal head in my glass. This beer had a very large bouquet of fruit in the smell. It was overall pretty citrus-y with a mix of orange and lemon smells in it as well as a small hint of the hops in the beer. Once I tasted it, the smell of the fruit obviously right. It produced a slightly woodsy taste to it (almost reminiscent of cedar). It also had an aftertaste of the hops and barley. The beer was also extremely carbonated. Also, of note, the combination of the carbonation, fruits and the sweet flavors almost made this beer seem like a wine. The progression of flavors and textures in the beer made this probably one of the smoothest beers Ive ever had."

Despite best efforts there is heaps of floating sediment. Resonable slightly off white head that disappears pretty quickly. Aroma is quite sweet with plenty of malt and toffee aromas.

Dark, hazy copper colour, very big, soapy off-white head that collapses rather quickly. Bottle-conditioned double. Complex aroma of fruit, aniseed and candy, not unlike a fruity Bavarian Hefeweizen. The complexity is maintained in the taste: very sweet and fruity at first, then sour and spicy, with a strong and lingering candy-like finish. Aftertaste somewhat bitter. The 7 % abv will weigh you down easily, but theyre well integrated into the taste fabric. However, this is a very sweet-ish Belgian double, and if you dont like that kind of taste, steer clear of Chimay (also of the ""Bleue"" variety). You should drink this cool IMHO, otherwise the sweetness may become too penetrating. While this is clearly a well-crafted brew, I still favour the more bitterish English ESB equivalent.

Pour is a very murky brown with some floaties and a nice eggshell white head that gets pretty big bud also disappointingly dies down rather quickly.		Smell is great, bread and some light spice and malty goodness, no sign of hops.		Taste is surprisngly bold, mimicking the characteristics of nose with a bit more prominent spice. This is going to rank in front of the White but behind the Blue as far as my taste is concerned.		As with most Belgians, the mouth is refined to a point where you almost take it for granted. Relatively thin and bubbly, where it needs to be.		A fairly easy drinker for a relatively big beer, and definitely a good and slightly cheaper alternative to its bigger brother, but for me anyway it doesnt hang with some of the better dubbels around such as St. Bernarduss 8 and of course the King, Westy 8."

Corked & caged with a fairly hefty pop of the cork. Into an Ommegang chalice it goes.		Pours what can be described as a murky bourbon color. With a little less red it would resemble a dunkel. Almost a full-finger of bleached ginger-colored head, but it goes quickly, leaving slight yeasty wisps in its wake. Sparse, moderate-speed carbonation.		A slight Belgian sourness is in the forefront at first, but peelin the onion back, but theres plenty of dried and ripe dark fruits backing this deal up. The usual suspects...dates, plums...even a few prunes in there. A little cinnamon and clove with even a touch of praline sweetness behind it all and some dark muscat notes. This is what a Dubbel should be. Still, light-bodied enough not to scare anyone away.		Grain profile is rather hearty, but the taste and body are a little lean...at first. Sure, everythings in there from the nose but its more aromatic and may not deliver the impact as it rolls down the gullet. Grains and light stewy roast (is there Special B in here? New to the whole brewing deal but it seems like thats the ticket) are full-bodied as mentioned but overall weight class may be a bit lean. Good, but lean. The carbonation drives the spice home nicely with only a slight saltiness. Mental note: Let this one warm quite a bit. Would like just a little more sweetness - it actually seems a bit peppery...but its still quite good. Yeast electricity still shines.		This one plays lighter than expected - we have the carbonation to thank for that. Deep dark stewiness is countered by spritely carbonation and pepperiness and other spice along with yeast electricity to dance on the palate and enjoy the ride down. Finish is clean for a normally hefty style.		I have been meaning to review this for a few days but have had to go back to get more at the store. Yknow why? Cause I enjoy drinking it immensely and writing about it gets in the way of its enjoyment. Whaddya think about that? Its damn good."

There is a lot of pressure when I remove the cork, the beer tries to find its way out immediatly.		Colour: Chimay Premire leaves a reddish brown beer in the glass, slightly hazy with not much carbonation. The creamy head is thick and beige. It leaves a nice lacing on the glass when dissapearing very slowly.		Aroma: very sweet smell with a malty undertone and a spicy touch of pepper. A very inviting and intense smell.		Taste: Chimay Premire is a very drinkable beer with an ABV of only 7%. At first, the taste seems relatively simple, dominated by malts and hop bitterness. When taking a few more sips however, the beer becomes complex of taste and very well balanced with a warming alcohol presence. The full body is combined with a fresh crispness. The mouthfeel is a bit like syrup and sticky. The dry finish makes you longing for more instantly.		Try this beer with a beef stew  why not use it IN the beef stew. Chimay Premire will also go well with any grilled meat dish. And why not drink it as dessert ? Beats a cappucino !"

Man I could smell this beer from way above the glass.  All good things though!  It has a very yeasty smell, even though I saved the yeast dregs at the bottom of the bottle and saved them for my homebrew.  There is a nice dark fruit aroma as well, such as black cherries or tart plum.  Very nice.		The flavor is immediately lightly tart, which reminds me of grape juice.  A nice touch of sweet flavors from the fruitiness also fill in well.  It finishes with a yeasty dryness that doesnt linger longer than need be.

Serving:  11.2 oz bottle poured into my Chimay glass.  08-314 stamped on label.		A:  Pours a dark brown/copper.  Very cloudy and hard to see through.  Fine beige head.  Floaties big and small but not numerous.  Definite lace work. 		S:  Malty sweet aroma.  Reminds me of cheap whiskey aroma.  Toasty.  Complex.  There is a aroma I cant put my nose on.  Slight hops too, but not too noticeable.  Spice, clove.		T:  Fruity and sweet with a touch of hops.  There is that whiskey malt again.  Earth and wood, maybe a tad whiff of smoke too.  A slight alcoholic bite, but not bad at all.  Very flavorful.		M:  The carbonation is nipping at my tongue.  A longish finish makes me want to take another drink right away to replenish what Im tasting.  Just a tad dry and bitter.		D:  Very drinkable for 7% ABV.  Its not overly expensive for being a beer from one of the six Trappist breweries.  		Overall, I am very pleased with my first true Trappist brew.  I have read that Red is not the best from Chimay, but that ok because I bought the gift set with all three plus my awesome goblet.  So, I only have two more to look forward to!"

The deep copper color of this beer looks great in the glass (trappist of course), and it has a very pleasing yet subtle fruity aroma.  The balance of this beer is fantastic between the sweet malts, the slightly bitter hops, and the warmingly high (but not overly so) ABV.

I like this beer, but I dont really tend to order/buy it very often for some reason, but when I walked into Costco and saw this 3 pack (Red, White, and Blue) + a glass offering for like $12 I couldnt resist.  Thats a heck of a deal!  So, I, of course, enjoyed this one in my new Chimay glass.  This one is so easy to find, that it probably doesnt the respect it deserves, but it is a really good beer.  I wont hold its accessability against it, if anything, that should be a plus, becuase they make so much of it and they still make it so well.

If rating on that beautiful mahogany pour or the smells of ripe, dark fruit, this would be perfect. Drank this at the bar and it was still a little cold from the fridge, which seemed to mask the slight plum, raisins, grape, and prune taste I was getting. Nice subtle alcohol warmth at the end. Need to drink this a little warmer.		Re-rate, 1/20/2010 - Bottle - Dropped aroma from 10 to a 6. Not sure what I was thinking before. Still a nice beer, but way too hot. Masks some luscious flavors lingering below. Have a bottle in the cellar thats a year old. Will probably take it out in a year to see if that heat has subsided."

Rich brown with some red hue with a light tan head that starts big but fades fast to an 8th of an inch and holds - no lace.  Aroma is pretty solid and very typical of the style - sweet candy, vanilla, dough, dark fruity (like plums), some booze and licorice, and yeast.  The flavor is the same but a bit less yeasty and just a bit better in general.  Not overly sweet like many Belgians, but still sweet.  Chimay hides the alcohol pretty well in this one, though it does heat the stomach pretty noticeably.  Medium to light bodied with over-the-top carbonation like most other Belgians, all of which I am not a huge fan of.  Overall: a solid brew, but wouldnt want more than one (or even more than about 8 ounces).  A generally over-hyped overrated style IMO -- I just dont get much complexity or sense much drinkability from it, and a good style has to have one or the other."

Appearance: The body has a beautiful deep dark brown colored body with dark ruby highlights and a slightly hazy body. The head builds up tall and thick with an abundance of small tiny, tight packed bubbles. It has a creamy off white color and good retention as it slowly settles down to a light thin covering. Lacing is very slick and minimal.		Smell: The aroma has an intoxicating mix of sweet malt, earthy yeast and dark fruity esters.		Taste/Mouth feel: Ageing only adds more complexity and character and each sip will reveal different flavor notes. To start there is a nice lightly roasted, almost smoky malt with different layers of dark fruits that is revealed as it warms. Plums, figs, dates, dark and golden raisins are some fruits I noted and all is surrounded buy the presence of a pleasant warming port like alcohol. Its palate is full and well rounded with a smooth feel and mellow carbonation.		Notes: For me this is about as close to perfect as a beer could be. It is an absolute pleasure for all the senses."

This stuff looks good, really dark brown with your typical cottony Belgian foam. Alcohol and roasty spice & a little ripe fruit in the aroma. Taste is nice, a little bit of booze fumes tickle your sinuses as you get some roasty, rich malt flavor polished off by a little zing that I can only compare to grapeskins, if that makes any sense. Its got just a little dash of sweet but not in a bad way, it leaves the palate pretty clean and doesnt build up in an unpleasant syrupiness at all.  Great beer to have with a steak.

The reddish brown body held tiny particles which swirled and begged me to drink them. The smell was a tantalizing array of fruits, but the burnt caramel and toffee were the leading scents, some rising yeast as well. Burnt toffee was again apparent in the taste, as well as roasted malt and fermenting fruit on the sides of the tounge. It doesnt mask the alcohol well, its true, but still a delicious creation! Light and oily on the palate, soft carbonation, slight alcoholic aftertaste. This is a classic."

I used to order this at the Dubliner in Omahas Old Market district. The Dubliner was an Irish style cellar pub with a Blarney Stone (every St. Paddys Day youd see inebriated revelers drunkely embracing and smooching it) at the top of the stairs leading to street level, traditional Irish music and an Irish board of fare. 20 years ago, the Dubliner was my preferred bar in Omaha so I revisited this brew to see if was still the way I remembered it.	The aroma is sweet-plums, pears, yeast with a hint of rose or  maybe lilac-Im not sure cant really pin it down.	It has a moderate sweetness with carmelized fruit notes and the alcohol lights you up without a noticeable taste. Velvety mouthfeel and delicate carbonation.	A very fine complex beer (why did I wait 20 years to drink this?)-maybe Ill start bringing it when I tailgate at Arrowhead.	GO CHIEFS!-(see Im an optimist)."

Pours a dark, murky brown, slight orange tinge to it making it appear copper toned when held to the light, with a smaller than expected white head. Aroma right away is what you would come to expect, yeasty wheaty maltyness, with the obligatory dark fruity aspects. Flowery and perfume-like, which is quite elegant and pleasant as it warms. Flavour is more of the same, with a decent thick feel to the body of this brew. Herbal-like hopping is present as well. Good sweet malts in the aftertaste. My only big problem with this is what I have with a lot of beers like it, in that I just dont really get much complexity from it. Its probably a pretty fresh bottle, and with plenty of age Im sure it could be something great. I just dont have the patience for such things. All in all a good one though. I meant to give it a higher rating but the numbers just dont seem to add up the way Id like them to. It does of course get much better as it warms."

Pops explosively open with a waft of black cherry fruit, blood, apple yeastiness, a sniff of roasted malt, raisin, ALCOHOL. A promising start. Forms a gushing tan head in the bottle but dies instantly in the glass. The thinness and booze-drenched finesse of McChouffe or Kasteel Bruin, minus a few tablespoons of sugar. Way too much marzipan (alcohol) for me, with no depth of character to back it up. Totally embarassed by its Trappist brothers (Westmalle Dubbel, Westies, Rocheforts). This is more a watery Scotch ale or barley wine than it is a fat, hallucinatory monastic bruiser. Seriously disappointing, and not for the first time. I could brew better in my shed.                                       	(original rate)...Porterish black-brown topped with a creamy beige. Sillky mouthfeel. Apple and caramel opening up in the nose as it warms. But an oddly underwhelming and flavourless ale for the ABV. Dour and sugary with an unsubtle waft of spiritous booze and a fairly caustic bitterness in the finish. No spice, no roastiness, certainly no hops (extract).

Starts off with a nice thick, almost white head. The beer appears almost black in a low-lit room, but held to the light it demonstrates a ruby red colour. The head settles down to a thin, but steady, layer and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is malty and mellow, but with a slightly sharp hint. Hits the lips like velvet. Smooth texture with a malty, only slightly bitter taste that ends with a hit of alcohol. I expected that this would go a bit skunky in the closet, considering the conditions, but it turned out to be a great, late night bev. Il have to try a brand new bottle for comparison."

Fairly strong aroma, bready malt and belgian yeast as expected, some alcohol, raisins/grapes,  with a minor light citrus fruit.  Very murky, grey sediment mixed in with the grayish-light brown color, pour had decent pillowy head, dissipated eventually, little lacing that doesnt stick.   Similar to the chimay red with that slight roasty bite to it that lingers into the finish in the back of the throat, very evident yeast flavor with darker sweet dough malt, also almost like a dark berry fruit, little bitter fades into the aftertaste quickly.

Spicy, earthy nose with notes of cellar, liquorice, dried fruit and black-currant. Malty, fruity, spicy taste with dried fruit, liquorice, hints of ginger, black-currant, chocolate and a spicy, fiery finish. Slightly earthy, but less cellar and more dark fruit in the flavours than in the aroma. Slightly above medium body, sweet but never cloying. Very nice, truly a classic."

Pours an attractive ruby brown that is cloudy.  Aroma is of malts and spices, a wonderful blend that I cannot do justice to by description.  Features an smooth flavor of soft malts, brown sugar, caramel, roasts, wood and alcohol.  There must also be some fruit notes in there, because this beer is rich and complex, without sacrificing perfect crisp drinkability.  The soft carbonation brings out the flavors.

Deep red colour. Taste initially strong malt and rich fruit, then a hint of coffee, chocolate and treacle, then a bit of iron which combined with the malt made it taste briefly like a health drink.  Too many floaters by the end to finish it. Aftertaste initially pleasantly malty, but with a sickly syrupy-sweet mouth coasting.  After a while fades to leave sourness.  Pleasant but disappointing - I actually thought that the Chimay Red was a far better balanced beer."

All that is needed to say, is that after countless very good Belgian beers, this beer is still striking.  Pours dark brown with porous white head.

One of the most important rules for drinking this beer is to drink it out of proper glassware. It really releases the full flavor which is what its all about. Great beer when you want to sit back and enjoy some of the finer things in life.

Beatiful swirling hypnotizing pour in a darker brown liquid. Decent fizz on the palate. Alky shows thru on the tongue at times. I guess I am a little crestfallen considering the percentile of this brew. Chimay white was much more enjoyable than this, but what should I expect for a strong ale.  Strong ales are not one of my favorites. I just thought that it would be a little more refined than the typical american wanna bee belgie strong ale. Not what I expected. Reminds me of the letdown when, in eager anticipation from the raters on this site, that I tasted my first highly rated imperial stout. Finish is not long lingering but it is a little alky bitter."

This sample was old before I had it so could have a couple of years extra, it had the shield on the cap rather than the current wording. Dark brown with ruby hints, slight head. I love Chimay Bleu to be aged, the flavours amalgamate into a porty, smooth blend with caramel and burning alcohol. The spiciness has matured to where the flavours cannot be picked, it a fireside warmer on a cold winters night, warm in the glow that your football team has just won, a pleasing and hearty friend.

Picked up this 11.2oz bottle at Discount Drinks in Wyandotte.		Appearance: Pours a hazy brown color with a 1 finger tan head. The head fades quickly on this one. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the others, just not quite as nice.		Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed roasted malts and more dark fruits, possibly cherry. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms, just like the others. Not as pronounced as the others.		Flavor: Starts sweet with some nice malt notes. There are hints of cherry and dark fruits. In the finish, there iswarming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors.		Palate: This starts creamy followed by the sweet dark fruits. These flavors hang for a short while. This is very smooth too. This doesnt seem like 9%, but after a few, you know it is. I could put back about 4 or so of these, but its best when comsumed slowly and enjoyed.		Overall. This finished last behind the Rochefort 10, Westy 12, and Abt 12. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others) thats probably the most available of the four we had.

It poured a dark red-brown color with a big, creamy, light tan head that had good retention and little cling.

Dark amberish in color, with a thin light head, followed with some lacing.  Aroma isnt too distinct at first, but comes out as it rests a minute.

One of the best beers I ever had. A nice taste of raisins, soy, chocolate and coffee. Sweet and warming alcohol. (4,3)		Jan 25, 2008, 33 cl bottle at Pitchers Pub, Karlstad, Sweden (2007 vintage). Dark brown colour with at thin white head. Malty aroma with chocolote, coffe, raisins and sugar. Sweet flavor with fruit in the background. (4,5)		Jan 31, 2008 (1999 vintage). It was a very nice experience. Matured plums, portwine/madeira, some brown sugar, raisins and some soy sauce together with broth(?). Very, very nice experience but to be honest I think it was better a couple of years ago.		June 18, 2008 (2007 vintage). This is still a very good beer, but unfortunly I didnt find it that amazing this time. I prefer a Rochefort 8 every day over this one. I dont say this isnt high quality though. Probably need too store a couple of these, even though I like the fresh ones.  They need to rest standing a couple of weeks before drinking though... otherwhise they explode spreading beer all over the appartment. (4,3)		Oct 24, 2008: 1999 vintage (again). Pours a dark brown color with small, dying head. Its probably a lot due to the age and the alcohol. Aroma is amazingly vinous with notes of dried fruits, raisins, plums, portwine, some alcohol... flavour is mostly sweet with lots of dried fruits, moastly raisins and plums. Very wine-like actually, but in a good way. It tastes great after almost 10 years... this is how a Chimay should taste like, I really liked it."

I am totally convinced that there was a major decline in Chimay Bleu between 2003 and and 2004. The 2003 vintage is amazing today - almost as good as Westvleteren 12, but the 2004 and forward are weak.		The 2003 pours a brown ale with a low head. It has an amazing strong aroma of plume, walnuts, caramel, spice, madeira, port and liquorice. The flavours are all spicy, vineous and well combined.

Pours a deep dark burgundy with a large fluffy off-white head.  Aroma has a lot to offer and its all rather subtle.  At first, plums, prunes, and raisins are the most noticable, but afterwards, I notice toasted almonds, brown sugar, molasses and vanilla.  All those sweeter notes are pretty subtle though.  Tastes initially of pears, quickly overtaken by brown sugar, a light toasted bread taste, almonds, cherries, light coffee and just the slightest warming bit of alcohol.  Finishes with a gentle but noticably bitter (in comparison to the rest of the beer) roasty flavor, a slight pear and raisin flavor, fading with a dirty earthy hop aftertaste.  Overcarbonated mouthfeel at first that can be solved with a lot of glass swirling.  Very drinkable for its strength, and kinda slick feeling.  I think one year took some of the edges of this beer and made the flavors even more well rounded.  This is just a classic strong Belgian ale, much smoother and subtler than competetors (at the risk of being slightly less exciting, maybe).			I gotta bump up my rating a bit.  The flavor of the second, more cloudy glass is just too good.  A bit of that yeast, but certainly not all of it, just makes this excellent.  A bit more vinous in the nose, yet a bit more vanilla in the flavor.  I had this beer years before rating number one, well before I graduated, and even at 360-something in the ratings numbers, its still awesome."

Ok this beer is lack luster in the appearance department pouring a murky muddy brown with slight burgundy hues and a nice creamy off white head that lasts very nicely. After the initial let down on the appearance this beer picks its game up big time. Sweet aroma of raisins, prunes, yeast, brown sugar, tropical fruit and a slight touch of alcohol perhaps Brandy. This gem has one of the most amazing palates I have ever experienced. Starts off with a full mouth feel and lively carbonation but as you swallow the body becomes light and the carbonation lessens to slide down your throat. Almost no aftertaste leaves you wanting another sip to recapture that moment of pure palate bliss. Sweet flavor of light yeast, sugar, raisin, and brown bread.

Finish is very warm and sweet.  Among Chimays, I prefer the White; the flavor is more balanced and subtle.  The Blue has too much fruit in the flavor; tastes similar to prune juice and desert wine.

A nice dark Ruby colour with a great foamy white head that lingers, so you can savour this one. Its like a good red wine that has loads of culture, and loads to talk about. My favourite Chimay. One to respect. At 9 percent strength, you cant taste it.. Good lace effects on the glass that shows quality. The aroma is quite complex, you have the yeast foremost, with a slight roasted nut hue to it. The tase is much appreciated once you have a few sips. Yeasty, roasted nutty, with slight sweet hints of fruits and caramel, the aftertaste is exquisite too, not too bitter considering the yeast and strength.

Poured into a trappist glass, 2007 bottle. Really packs a punch with me as well compared with all other 9% abv yet the intensity is beautifully blended quietly in the flavor. Medium head that reduces quickly but stays low for some time. Aroma says to you ""yes I have lots of complexity but dont need to show it off and bash you over the head with it"".

Been wanting to try this for a while... wish granted.  Nose is nutty rosted malt with a light floral/fruity scent.  Fantastic looking beer with a coppery brown hue posessing a nice toasted marshmallow head.  The mouthfeel on this beer is fantasticly perfect.  The flavor profile is as complex as I had hoped.  The yeast imparts the floral/fruity hints to a slightly nutty profile with a full roundhouse kick of malt.  Theres enough hops present to keep the beer balanced, but I couldnt really detect anything the hops may have added to the flavor profile.  Overall this is a fantastic beer.  Something to be drank daily if youre the son of a wealthy Texas oil man, but for a simple man like me, its a fantastic treat to be savored when I can ""treat"" myself.  Im a HUGE fan of pairing beer with food, this beer would seem to be great with alot of fare depending on what youre trying to accomplish; suggestions would be Dim Sum, well spiced seafood dishes, and something as rustic as an openfaced sandwich or stew."

Aroma is a bit lacking, but provides hints of dark fruits, applesauce, brown sugar, and some yeastiness.  Flavor is also solid, but a bit ""eh"", well rounded with some dark fruit, apple, and a bit boozy.  Palate is well carbonated and lively, with a lingering finish.  I had this a few times before my official entry into ""craft beer"", and remember being much more impressed than I am now.

Well to start, my mouth is watering just thinking about the rich flavor and complexities. It has a wonderfully faint coffee aroma, and an even further distant sent of chocolate. Make no mistake this is no type of chocolate stout or mocha flavored beer. This is a true beauty. Unique to itself and wonderfully crafted to have you craving more so the larger bottle is a must.

Was given a gift of a large bottle in 1996 soon after I started brewing.  I remember being at awe thinking about drinking beer made by monks.  Chimay blue was spectacular, and gave me a brewing goal.  I thought it was the best beer.  Around 2001-2002, I started to think the red version was better.  It was also about this time it seems Chimay was mass producing.  It wasnt until years later around 2003, that I started to appreciate many other beers, with a huge influence from ratebeer.  Now, Im finally rating my old favorite.  I probably havent tried it in over a year.  Pours with a head that disappears immediately.  There still carbonation, but just no head.  Hmmm?  Aroma of something fruity, not quite banana.  A bit too much alchohol in the nose.  Deep brown red amber color.  Great color.  Taste is good, on the sweeter side, but something is off, possibly the tiniest amount sourness.  Not quite the masterpiece I once thought it was.  Is it because of mass production, or improved taste buds.  I wonder if I could get a hold of an older bottle. 7/3/7/3/16:3.6	10/25/07:  Rerate.  I dropped this 33cL bottle and some leaked out the cap.  I stuck it in the frig for a month.  Just opened, and it still has carbonation!  What a surprize.  Rocket fast fading medium bubble head, that settles to a microbubble head.  Interesting.  Some buttery melanoidin malt aroma.  I think this bottle is over a year old from the dust on the bottle.  Much nicer than fresh: 7/4/8/4/17: 4.0"

It tasted over the hill.  Perhaps I got a poorly handled bottle."

Pours beautiful dark chestnut, a bit lighter where the glass thins out, with an initially tall, foamy, beige head that settles pretty quickly. Aroma is spicy Belgian yeast, some slightly sweet malts, dark fruit, tobacco, and alcohol.

I dont like what this ale leaves on my breath. Is that the finish or the after-finish? Aroma is a little bit stale--by intent, I conjecture. Either way its probably the worst I have to say about it.

Although the smell was disappointingly mild, the rich great tasting flavor is excellent. It is strong and reminiscent of Bush, but has a subtlety that reminds me of Newcastle Brown Ale. It is superior to each of those beers in their own areas of expertise. There is a smoothness between foretaste to full-flavor and the resulting aftertaste. The change is not so wide as that famous one found in the English brew. Yet the superior flavor makes the subtle change an even more pleasant experience. There is a delicious combination of flavors tightly wound in an equally potent drink. Bush is wonderful. 12% with no overpowering alcohol taste. The Chimay Blue is no less potent. It is smoother and less bitter. It is similar in flavor, but more interesting and more refined. The other offerings from Chimay are all good. Their blue bottle is in another league.

For whatever reason Ive been overlooking it until now.  I cant imagine why as it is one of the best beers I have had the chance to sample.  The only hard thing about it will hanging onto another bottle for three years to age it again.  The cork on this bottle said 08/03.	Aroma / Appearance - The half finger tan head danced over the top of the bronze body creating a beautiful scene.  A reddish tint gave it some more life.  The creamy nose consisted of caramel, chocolate, anise and black cherry.  A hint of fruits floated above it all creating a very dense and complex combination of scents.  I could smell this one for a while without ever taking a sip.	Flavor / Palate - The first sip unveiled a chewy rich tapestry of flavors.  Opening with cherries, chocolate and raspberry sorbet, it then morphs into black pepper and vanilla.  It is not quite on par with St Bernadus or Rochefort but it is so close that I would never turn it down.  The alcohol has a certain prescence that is evident but never threatens to overwhelm the palate.  For an almost four year old beer this had held up exceptionally well.  I wonder how long it would last."

A mild, warm Belgian yeast sugar party collides with nips of coffee and toffee, hanging around for the Champagne to be opened. A lot of rising pale fruits meddling in the affairs of the darker kind. A certain burnt sugar quality, amongst a grainy tooth. Carbonation prickles with hops and lends at least some refrain to the syrup. Probably better aged."

And I have to say that with the benefit of quite a bit more beer experience since my last rating, that I significantly over-rated this beer in my previous rating.  Yesterday, I found this beer is extremely mild, and while certainly not unpleasant or bad, I found it to be a bit boring.  Of the three varieties I had yesterday, this was definitely my least favorite.		Appearance was a dark brown/almost black color with a decently-formed whitish head with limited staying power.  Aroma was very mild and faint.  I got roasted malt and a bit of alcohol, but not much else.  Flavor was the highlight of this beer, but even that I found mild-mannered and rather unremarkable compared to other dark Belgian (or Belgian-style) beers Ive had.  A bit of roastiness and some alcohol, but not much else that you might expect like spiciness or fruit.  Mouthfeel was not bad, but unremarkable.		So Im left to explain why so many think so much of this beer while Im the odd-duck whos unimpressed.  And my hypothesis is this - that many folks (me among them) try this beer when first expanding their beer horizons, are wildly impressed by the difference, but havent yet revisited (as Im now doing) to compare against the craft/import beer adventures theyve had since breaking out with Chimay Blue.

As anyone familiar with bottle conditioned ale knows, theres a marked difference between a bottle that is properly handled, with the sediments on the bottom, and a bottle that has been jostled to the point where the sediments irreversibly alters the flavor, even after its been sitting on the shelf for awhile. Whatever shipping method is used to transport this otherwise top-of-the-line beer has spoiled it irreparably, and I feel sorry for those who are exposed to Chimay the first time in Auckland, because if they dont like sweet beer, they wont come back for more."

It was long before I started my journey into the world of beers, though. The second time was in the beginning of my rating career, actually it must have been one of the 5 or 10 first, so it must have been in May 2004, and I still didnt like it, but then again, I really didnt like the Belgian beers back then. So in July 05 I felt ready to give it another try, and Im glad I did. It is dark brown with a lot of chunky sediment and the head is beige and nice. The aroma has notes of dark, ripe fruits and a bit of alcohol. The flavour is complex: warming alcohol, plum, raisin, port wine, caramel sweetness and a hint of licorice - and it mingles well into a higher and well balanced unity.

Aroma is pleasing with honey, gingerbread, and ginger candy notes. Flavor is dominated by malts, with some raisin elements and ice tea highlights, no off flavors and an INCREDIBLY smooth finish. I guess that the leadup to this beer left me wanting a bit more...is that fair? Certainly a very nice beer, but Ill try other Belgain offerings before I return to this. 5.50 USD at the bottle shop in Anchorage....in Panama the beer sucks but its cheap, I guess the opposite is going to be true for this trip to Alaska.		Re-rate on the finish of the bottle. Definately grew on me....the flavor stayed with the beer through the warming, with more floral and ice tea notes. Quite, quite nice. Love Belgian beer..."

A light yeasty dough rasin aroma, not bad but light at the point that we came to it.  Brown rasins, sugar, sweet, hops, in need of a malt backbone.  The heat is too much with the light medium body.

The beer poured into the chalice deep amber with a tannish head which rose slightly and fell quickly but laced at the glass. The flavor was nicely malty and crisp with toffee and dark caramel coupled with Belgian yeast spice which was slightly peppery, contained cinnamon and clove. the dark fruits from the aroma came through in the flavor and contained raisin and prune characteristics.

If you are a fan of Abbey ales, this will blow you away. Do not be fooled by the 9% alcohol content. The beer goes down very smooth, and is not like the Rouge or Cinq Cints  when it comes to feeling heavy. The other two Chimay Trappist Ales leave me feeling full. However, Chimay Bleue has a more complex variety of aroma and taste that will not make you feel like you just ate a whole turkey. Although I love all beers  the Notre Dame Abbey at Scourmont has to offer, this is definitely my favorite! Enjoy with Roquefot Cheese. Or a mild to medium-bodied cigar with thick creamy smoke. Preferrably a Padron Anniversario, or Fuente Hemingway Series."

Pours a hazy, deep, dark ruby-brown color with a mostly fully head, beige, and fizzy, but still creamy; settles to an average constant layer leaving some tight lacing.  Very intriguing nose for a dark Belgain with some floral notes, even some herbal notes, some darker malt notes, even a little vinous;  other notes of dough, light banana, and raisin.  Tastes more like a trappist than the nose led on with very rich malt flavors and typical yeasty notes, Belgian chocolate, rich caramel, hints of chicory, brown sugar, prune, light banana, mild hints of the floral towards the end keeping the beer from becoming cloyingly rich.  Palate is just more than medium, but somewhat round, making it seem much fuller, and lively; I didnt like the palate at first becasue of the lighter body and amount of carbonation, but it grows on you.  I was trying to compare it to other trappist palates, and that would just decrease the character of the beer, this one is too different from the others to be categorized the same way.  Finishes fairly long and mostly sweet with brown sugar, prune, and doughy yeast and the dryness becoming more apparent as well as a nice warming effect.  A good amount of alcohol warmth from the 9% but that only accentuates the beer.  Not at all what I was expecting from a trappist, but I was pleasantly surprised after having a few sips.  Not overly complex for a top level trappist, but quite refreshing as compared to others.  This one is much more subtle with the flavors and has many notes that I wasnt expecting from a trappist.  The more I drink the more I like it.  Very well put together and the delicacy of beer makes for something incredibly memorable."

The flavor has remnants of caramel at the beginning, which gives way to a bread like flavor, rather interesting flavors, I taste some bruised banana somewhere in their aswel, when the beer becomes closer to room temperature sweet flavours of bruised fruit, plums, raisins, and marzipan come through, very complex.

Rerate: Dominating roasted malt, thyme, candy and alcohol. Not overly complex. Additional comment: Weak nose. Medicinal with notes of plums and aniseed. Not all that good. There are way better Belgian strong ales."

No lacing.  The palate is full-bodied and well carbonated.  The flavor leads with Initial maltiness, sharpness and carbonation sting which fades to a mild, caramelly note, and finishes with a 	lasting, mild bitterness.

Bouquet has the characteristic Belgian beer smell; very gentle flowery/fruity smell, with a punch of a smell that is acrid.  One writer calls out ""caramels"" and at the suggestion its hard not to notice.  Color is a nice a warm brown nutty color, but the beer being unpasteurized/unfiltered and bottle conditioned is pretty cloudy.  It is very drinkable and smooth, flavor is understated and not all that memorable.  The high alcohol content goes right to your head ;)  Definitely a top-notch beer, but not my favorite"

The aroma is reminiscent of caramels, malts and pulled taffy.  Beautiful  hazy, opaque dark red color with thick half frothy, half bubbly tan head of two fingers.  The flavor is indeed complex with flavors seeming to hit you in stages as the beverage warms.  Delicately spicy but the dominant flavors are the malts and yeasts.  Contrary to most other strong belgian ales, this one lacks the characteristic fruitiness in the aroma and flavor.  Mouthfeel is warm due to the high alcohol content, the cask conditionning makes this heavier beer seem to evaporate on your tongue like a champagne.  In all I was a little bit disappointed since I had the highest expectations (I still think I enjoyed the Chimay Red and Whites better) but this is without a doubt one of the finest beers commonly available."

The aroma is delicate with dried fruits, yeast, and malty sweetness.  The flavor is similar to the nose, with the fruit flavors and a caramel sweetness being the most prominent flavors.

Overall, it deserves the reputation that is has as one of the best Belgians that you can find most anywhere with a decent beer selection."

Pours with a NICE thick head (barring almost stripping all the skin off my fingers trying to take the cork out) and a dark ""cola"" red brown liquid. Odd scent, fruits of aged cider and grape. The scent also contains some smell of old musty wood.Some reasonable lacing on the glass. Not as fizzy as other Chimays on the tongue. Some definite sweet malts as well as it works around the tongue. Just ever so slight bitterness, but well-balanced. I dont quite pick up the direct raisin (not as a doppelbock) but there is some grape origin hints. Generally quite plesant (having this with a HUGE cheese plate)  and pairs well with food. (Bottle Pour 12/9/2006 - aged from my March birthday party)"

A similar taste to the Chimay Rouge, but much stronger, and more of an alcohol finish.  The light floral quality from the Rouge is much more obvious with the Bleue.  Id agree with others that this beer could benefit from a few years of aging.  As it gets warmer, it gets a little bit too sharp. Its certainly not an everyday drinker like the Rouge could be, but its much more complex, and much more of a treat, like a dark chocolate would compare to a chocolate bar.

Unknown Vintage (very old label though)	6/26/2009:  Chimay Blue has an amazing aroma containing caramelized malts, rich dried fruits (dates, figs, plum, raisin), chocolate, sugary Tootsie Roll, well-aged port, and brown sugar.  The hint of oxidation really does wonders for the aroma.  It has a blunt, dark brown color.  There isnt much carbonation left as only a thin beige heads forms after the pour and promptly disappears.  There is some fine sediment suspended within the liquied as well.  The flavor doesnt quite deliver what the aroma suggested.  It is plenty sweet and malty with lots of brown sugar, caramelized malt, hints of dried fruits (dates, raisins), and cola, but the depth and complexity has been obscured by quite a bit of cardboard oxidation at this point.  This also causes the beer to feel thin and limp in the mouth.

When I first tried it, I did not know what to think, but understood immediately that this was a quality beer. The taste was a little too strong and the alcohol was overwhelming. However, when returning to America I picked up the 75cl bottle and drank it at a punk show. Not only did I feel more dignified, but in contrast to all the malt liquor in the room, I finally grasped the full goodness of this beer. The taste was rich, sweet and creamy. Every sip of the beer was excellent and when the bottle was finished, I regretted that I had to begin drinking a lower quality beer and lamented nostalgically on the excellent beer consumed."

Let me preface by saying Im not the biggest fan of the style. Pours ruby-dark brownish, with a big tan head that dissipates swiftly. BIG - no HUGE  fruity aroma that yields to a slight malt ending. You would think such a powerful and vibrant whiff of fruit would be overbearing, but it lingers only momentarily and is balanced perfectly by the malt ending. A feast for your nostrils! I know thats a lot of words to waste on a simple smell - but this beer really smells great. On to the taste: Almost no bitterness, with mostly fruit and malty overtones. Very sweet and sugary. Thicker then your average beer, but the body isnt quite full enough for me. Although because of this perhaps, its definitely easy to drink despite its high alcohol content (9%)  A good example of a style Im not particularly keen on (but what a smell!)."

Obvious Chimay yeast character that I recognize from my own homebrewed beers using the same yeast. I find the beer to be disappointing, and not very interesting.

Molasses/dark fruit sweetness with a little roastiness, some vanilla, and some yeasty hints way in the back. The flavor is unexpectedly enormous considering the understated aroma. Glorious. Roasty and alcoholic (though not offensively so) and very vinous at first, full of prunes and dates with a hint of tartness and some oak. The finish is almost songworthy, reminiscent of good scotch--short but with an impressive progression of flavors and sensations from sweet/vinous/sumptuous with a whisp of vanilla in the middle to dry/tingly/woody.

Lacing was excellent. The aroma was malty and dark fruit, mostly grapes and alcohol. As the glass warmed, the alcohol became much more evident in the smell. Ditto for the taste. At first, the flavor was slight malty sweetness, and pleasant clove spices. At mid-glass, the alcohol became the dominant taste. The finish, whiile pleasant, was warming and again, dominated by alcohol.		In conclusion, I enjoyed this beer, and it is definitely a classic rappist Ale. I might drink another on a cold winters night (instead of todays 90+ dgree weather). But at only 9% abv, the alcohol was a little too noticeable in taste and smell, as I felt more like I was drinking shots of whiskey."

Initial aroma of raisin, sweet malt, and toffee. Not nearly as fruity as I remembered.

With its wide availability I often have one of these with me no  matter where im at. Not quite as deep as some other belgians but very tasty! Yeasty and musky flavors come through in a nice way. Good dark fruity flavors are present. To me it also has a little bit of a chocolate milk, or maybe a cocoa flavor in there, too. Massive rocky head that you would expect from a belgian. Lacing is beautiful - like a well woven spider-web down my entire glass. I always buy this one thinking that I only need one because of its ABV, but always wish I would have bought two. Drink it warm-ish like you would most Belgians of this style, but dont let it get too warm, the alcohol becomes more present in both the nose and the flavor."

It pours a very dark brown (almost black) liquid with reddish tones and a high and consistent high head that leaves a nice lacing. Delicious look. The aroma is yeasty and fruity, with some spices. I can smell dark fruits, ripe pears, fresh bread, a little herbal hops and a roasted malts base; impressive. It is nice the way the 9% of alcohol are completely blent with the brew. It tastes likewise, with a good deal of yeast and a complete malt base, with dark fruits, ripe pears, a little light caramel, general mild roastiness and even a little wood. The palate is perfect: a little prickle in the mouth and the tongue from the calmed but lively carbonation (as well as the alcohol), a full body with a very dense sensation in the mouth. It has a great and long finish: sweetness, some caramel and roasted malts; mild but lasting. Some herbal hints also. There is almost no bitterness (nor dryness) in this beer, being basically sweet. Smart presentation (bottle and crown cap) for my favourite one. No beer can make me feel like Chimay Bleue does. Might be the best in the world."

Bottle into a *Westmalle* (gasp) trappist glass. Dark bronzey and reddy-brown, very gorgeous red color when placed in the sunlight. Some floaty stuff, and the head is thick and foamy with a very light brown coloration. Quite active carbonation. Looks very ""happy"" if you will, and its quite beautiful. 		Aroma: Sweet, like dry fruits, complemented by a dark, earthy and woody smell and a small hint of yeastiness which reminds me of bread a bit. Reminds me of black licorice somewhat too.		Taste: A darkish, sweet taste almost like brown sugar that gets just a little bitter; you can taste the malt in this one. Aftertaste is a light bitterness along with alcohol, kinda like the stronger cough candies. Again, reminds me of black licorice. VERY nice. 		Palate: Smooth, though foamy and almost oily and dare I say thick, though not in a bad way. Leaves a residue behind in your mouth that feels very active and alive. Warming too. Lots of carbonation.		Overall: Very nice, cheaper and easier to find than all of the Rochefort, but not quite as good, but I guess you get what you pay for. Not a beer to drink all the time, everyday, but I wont feel guilty cracking one open with a good meal every few days or so.

I definitely let some of the yeast on the bottom sneak in, but it still formed a decent thin head and looks like it has some serious substance.  The aroma is very winey.  Reminds me in particular of rieslings and other fruity whites.  I also pick up a bit of apple cider.  In the mouth theres some serious viscosI ity but rather than being sticky, this beer is slippery.  Strange, but not unpleasant at all, with good CO2 levels.  The flavors are a little harder for me to appreciate.  Admitedly, Belgians are not my favorite in general, so many strong sour flavors overload my tongue, but Im trying my best to be descriptive and positive rather than critical.  Definitely very strong grape flavors, incredibly winey.  Though it is dry in general, Id say theres a good deal of malt, with some roasty and smokey flavors shining through in an interesting way.  The alcohol definitely also makes itself known in the flavor.  Also, again, a bit of that apple cidery taste.  Perhaps Ive yet to have a good bottle of a Belgian, or maybe they are just too sour for me.  Overall, this was my favorite Belgian tried so far, but it has also been the least sour."

I may have agitated the bottle getting it out of the fridge. 		Thick, long lasting head of large bubbles bring the yeasty, apricot tinged vapors to the nose. The first hints of sourness are here, like fruit ripening on the tree. 		The palate is even, not overly strong in any one characteristic. The malty characteristics are balanced by the sourness and both conspire to hide the heavy alcohol content. No hint of the 9+% alcohol until you realize that it is rocking your face off. 		The sourness of the after-palate is a bit offsetting at first, but blends quickly until it is the taste you anticipate with your next sip."

Shows a huge creamy and rocky head that lasts for long and leaves a precious lacing.	Aroma is wonderfully rich, malty and yeasty in character. It has strong notes of nuts, dark chocolate, caramel and fruits like plums, prunes and a little of clove and Lapsang Souchong dark tea. I found also some touches of alcohol and toffee.	Flavor is very powerful with a blur of sweetness but bittersweet coffee-ish in character. There are hints of almonds, walnuts, caramel and red wine with some spicy layers. Complex yet incredibly smooth. 	The mouthfeel is thick and pleasant. It feels winy or maybe liquorish with an oily texture. Marvelous finish, eternal and full of boldness. In addition, the alcohol is masterfully disguised. Let it warm a bit and it will become a real gem.	Awesome.	Edition 2006 - drunk November 20 same year: Pretty much the same as above but a little less complex. I noticed the yeast was still working pretty hard in the bottle. I sure this one must be aged a couple of years to truly shine. However it was still a wonderful beer. 8/4/8/4/16 Score: 4.0		Edition 2005 - drunk August 2008: Now I know the hype was right. A properly aged, 3 years Chimay Bleue is an Elixir of the Gods. Loads of chestnuts, walnuts and caramel are the new impressions in the nose. Some rum or brandy-like alcoholic notes too, and everything gets rounded with a strong sherry character. In the flavor, more nutty hints, figs and brown sugar with the touch of sherry again. This beer was a jewel. Fantastic. 10/4/9/5/17: Score 4.5"

It overflowed after I poured it. The appearance is a hazy brown. Aroma was nominal, I found. I just couldnt pick up much, aside from some sweetness. The flavor, however, was quite pronounced and strong- this beer is very wine like. There was a good balance between the barley and hops, so I wasnt really able to pick up one or the other ingredient. Lots of over-ripe fruits (prune?) show up here. And, alcohol really makes its presence known. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, and Chimay ""Blue"" finishes dense. This is a sipper for sure.

Fresh yeasty fragrance of banana, pear, caramel, raisin, and lightly roasted malts.  Very powerful flavors initially grab the tongue with an almost sticky texture.  First, an oaky raisin and plumb grab the tongue.  After the carbonation splashes over the tongue and disperses, some sweet coffee flavors are noticed, almost like a Saturday morning mocha cappucino.  Finally, a bit of spiciness and black currant images come to mind as the finish is remniscent of a nice Cote Chailonnaise wine.  Overall, a very tasty and best yet,  wonderfully available beer."

(vintage 2003) Dark brown beer with lots of yeast floating around, and a small, dense beige head. Looks delicious. Aroma is lightly roasted malt, with caramel, dried fruit and a little spicyness. When tasted, youre first stuck by a fizzy mouthfeel, then the flavors of caramel, roasted malt and a little alcohol. There is some spicyness too. The finish leaves you with a balanced bitterness, and a light stickyness in the mouth, due to the sweetness of the beer. This is absolutely a beer to enjoy in the evening, much better than a night cap or a cognac, as it leaves you relaxex, comforted and pleased. I was enjoying it so much that I almost forgot to rate it before I hit the ""Add Rating""-button. The colour, ABV and all the other aspects of this beer would make it an appopriate beer for the Christmas dinner, maybe I should try that this year. It has to be a 0.75ltr bottle then. (060202)"

I will go so far as to say that it is the best beer in Belgium or Northern France, and this says something very good about the business in general: when the best beers are the most popular, there is something that is right in the world.  Now to the rewiew:  This pours a dark, almost black tint, that is accented by a plumb rouge and a bit of a purple tinge around the edges of the glass.  The carbonation rolls to the top of the glass like German tanks crashing over the Maginot line.  The mouthfeel is silky smoothe, but this fills out in the process of the sip to form a generous, fluffy texture.  The taste is lightly of chocolate and strongly of plumbs.  This balance is crucial --the malts are providing the flavor in this beer and that can sometimes be bad news, leaving only yeast or bread to the executive judgement of the palate.  However, the light fruitiness, here, cleans up the sometimes sticky malts and transforms the breadiness at the base of the flavor into a strong, lightly acidic, moderately sweet, strongly textured alcoholic delight that can only be aluded to.  The only catch is that youd better not be expecting any genuine hops when you pick up the glass.  All of this is a definitely good thing: Chimay is uniquely at the top of the enormous pile of Belgian beers."

This is an ale that has been tasted by near everyone with any interest in beer whether they have any inklings towards its roots or not. A background favourite of mine I waited until I had cracked a 2001 before rating this. 	2004- Poured into its own chalice at around cellar temperature. Extremely muddy with the yeast dispersing into a pulped fruit mess inside the cola brown body with an enormous, creamy beige crown raising up and persisting for the length to trail fine lacing down the glass. Heady aroma, quite woody almost oak-aged with fresh pulped zesty plums, red wine dryness, spicy yeast and an underlying earthy mustiness like old hops. Lovely smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel; vinous notes set it off and develop into an earthy woody mix of malt and hops. Plums and blueberries, driftwood, peppery alcohol and yeast phenols and a hint of pecan pie develop to linger long in the mouth hiding that 9% ABV. Warming and homely, this example seemed more woody than most that I have tried with a long finish that was like a well aged plum wine. Seemed to have more age than the 2001. Quite nice. (75cL, Nookenburra) 	2001- Poured into its own chalice at cellar temperature. Quite clear, deep ruby red with a tinge of brown. Head formed off the pour; extremely dense and creamy beige, held in place by streams of very, very fine bubbles to leave a mist over the glass as I drank. Pungent and tart, port-like nose with an immense spicy waft of alcohol and the famous house yeast. Other dried fruits were there with a lick of bitter/sweet chocolate and a touch of polished Jarrah (?). Extremely wine-like in the mouth; mellowing, smooth and yet prickly across the tongue with a good dose of medicinal alcohol that didnt hinder it at all. Blackcurrants, raisins and those distinctive plum notes abound, this was like an after dinner elixir to stir up the rawest of emotion, by the fire with a loved one perhaps. Finish is as smooth as silk letting the alcohol warm to its full extent along with a deeply vinous  roundness and depth. I love a good strong ale, and Chimay delivers with fervour. (75cL, Vintage Cellars, Adelaide)	 As I said who could go past a Chimay!"

The nose is filled with complex aromas. Aromas of spicy/musty yeast, marry with fruity estery aromas of plum, candy sugar, sweet malt, peppery alcohol, and herby hop character. The palate is firm, with big sweet and dark malt flavors paired with flavors of rock candy, fruity esters, and a back drop of spicy yeastiness. This beer finishes with more of those complex flavors up front, then ends with a warming, peppery alcoholic burn. 		 Some age in the cellar has taken those raw, young aromas and flavors of a young bottle, and make them more complex and deep. The aromas are more yeasty and spicy in nature, with a bit more malt and alcohol aroma, and a more rounded estery fruit note. The plummy notes will  become more vinous and port like.  A few years of age will  make a phenomenal beer even more complex, and delicious. 		This is a world class Trappist ale, and one of the most accessible of all the Trappist ales. It should be available in most US markets. Chimay has done more than any Trappist brewery to make beer lovers aware of these very special beer styles. This beer is the perfect match for strong blue veined cheeses, cured or smoked meats and fish. It also makes a wonderful after dinner drink, and a warming winter brew. Remember you can consume this beer either young or old, I have enjoyed it both ways."

So I headed up to BevMo with my best friend (who got a ticket on the way there HAH!), plunked down my money, took it home let it stay nice and cool in the garage overnight and opened it the next day. A HUGE head, Im talking seriously HUGE. A wonderful aroma of raisins, dates, plums and a spiciness. The taste had a nice roastiness flavor, with nutmeg and a peppery flavor. It had some teeth on it with a 9% ABV, so you could taste that also, which put me off a bit (reminded me of this really crappy French beer I once had). While this was an excellent dark ale, I would not say it belongs in the Top 5 on these lists. Too expensive for what little you get and didnt blow me away like I was hoping."

The froth form the head filled the glass.  The head then withdrew to a normal head.  The aroma was stonger with the yeast than the German Helles. The color was a deep dark brown.  The flavors were of roasted malt.  The first sip was overpowering but as I drank more the beer was more satisfying.  I like the IPA and Stout better but I want to try more these Ales.

Malts, especially dark fruity ones- plums, currants, dried berries- stand out here. Not extremely yeasty but just enough to provide a light tang to the aroma. A light spiciness- cloves, very light black pepper- is also here.		Quite sweet, much like the aroma; I detect a lot of the same dark fruits, alongside brown and candy sugar flavors. Hints of chocolate, bread, and the aforementioned (still minor) yeast make this one complex and enjoyable. With warmth, the dark fruits take on a grapy/raisiny/winy flavor.		Medium/full-bodied with moderate carbonation (a little less than I expected from a Belgian). Somewhat smooth, with a light warming effect from the alcohol.

Nose picked up boatloads of deep, dark fruits (plums, raisins), musty Belgian yeast, and a little bit of alcohol.  Flavor was able to take all that is great with the aroma, and really make it dance... dark fruit provided a sweet and salivating base, yeast gave the brew some spicy and musty character, and the alcohol was nicely warming at the top of the throat.  Balance was superb.  Smooth and velvety on the palate.  Finish was peppery, warm, and long-lasting.  This brew was excellent on all fronts!"

All these Eastern religion crazes and astrological ombudsmen always blather on about focus, finding ones center and maintaining spiritual energy at the nexus and vertex.  Everything from urban development to cake decorating is centered aroundwell, the center.  Proper balance has become a higher art, put into form in everything, including beer making.  And that paragon of centered flavor and palate is the Chimay Blue.  What a beautiful beer; beautiful in its precarious balance.  The color is like a light baby bears fur, and the foam a casual light tan color.  The whole appearance is gentle and soft, picturesque to anybody with a disposition to tactile experience.  The smell is extraordinarily complex, fuming with copious yeast and some teriyaki sauce.  I must say, the aroma is quite mild, not unlike the taste.  The flavor is just light enough to match perfectly with the palate.  The whole flavor compound lingers on the tongue for a long time, allowing the drinker to take his time and really immerse himself in the Chimay Blue experience.  It lets one center themselves, finding the same coveted balance that the brewers at Chimay instill in their signature beer."

It cant compare really to the beers made by Omnibroue, unless you are making a special category for vintage-era beers. Sure, it might have been the best there was 20 years ago, but we have made progress and these old style beers taste, well, out-of-date.		It is fine and agreeable, but has none of the complexity of a Trois Pistoles or Three Philosophers.		It tastes like a really good sparkling champagne-style beer, bubbly and effervescent, but not very substantial.		This is an excellent beer, but shows little signs of progress from what it was in its inception. If you get off on black and white movies, then you may love this brew."

While this is far from my first beer tasting, this is my first rating. My wife and I even went so far as to purchase a set of Chimay glasses to start things off right. Yeah, I know! Anyway, I was reasonably impressed, but not blown away by this beer. The aroma is very yeasty/doughy with some sweet odors and a bit of apple and citrus (lime/lemon). The head was fairly small and died off quickly - leaving a somewhat unattractive brown foam. While this was a bit disappointing, the overall appearance was very nice - like deep reddish brown shoe leather. At first I found the carbonation to be overly strong for my taste buds, but found this beer improved greatly after sitting in the glass for about ten minutes. Taste is fairly alcoholic and creamy. Overall, a very nice beer. (Addendum - after this rating, I had the opportunity to drink a ten year old Chimay Blue - Much, Much better - more like a 4.5)"

Poured a very small ochre thick head, and a completely misty dark brown colour, impressive, but not a 5 in my opinion. The nose was nice, raisins, plums, alcohol. Very complex taste. Nice plummy fruitiness giving way to a fine underlying lemony sourness forming in the middle a taste reminiscent of forest fruits, like forest strawberry. Id probably say it tasted like port with a sourish background, but Ive never tasted port so I wouldnt know (duh), and the best I can explain it as prosecco-but-not-as-sweet-with-a-sour-background. So there you go. Ah, right, aftertaste. Not much hops present, but they arent really needed here. Malty aftertaste that feels at times slightly odd, similar to what you get when sucking a peach seed (faint though)."

It has some of the heaviest lace you will see. As you tip the glass to sip it leaves behind a solid covering of tan foam with no breaks in it at all. Lovely! Sweet alcoholic nose with some rice pudding. Metailc (but in a good way), vanilla and strong caramel and cream is the order of the day flavour wise. Then it is all rounded off with and very long and amazing caramel and marzipan finish with some gradual alcohol warming. Glorious stuff. Make sure it is not over chilled, it will totally kill it and be careful with the sediment if its not your thing then I would suggest a gentle pour and pay attention. Grande Reserve variant is even better."

I cant find much in here. Theres some sweet malt and alchohol presence, but not a very significant flavor. body is just a tad thin, but the carbonation is done well. Drinkability was easy. 9% keeps you from drinking too many though.  Now I know why a lot of people say Chimay is overrated. I must say I agree.

It is FAR from a bad beer, but it doesnt deserve to be in the 99 percentile.

I was trying to save it for 10 years, but I ran ran out of fresh bottles. Whats a man to do? I subsequently realized that I have never rated Chimay, even though it has been one of my favorites for many years. It poured with a short (probably due to aging) tan head, eliciting a pleasant yeasty aroma. The alcohol was even less noticeable than usual from its mellowing over time. The flavor was still complex but more balanced than a fresh bottle, with a slightly chalky finish. The aging definitely altered the flavor but neither improved nor diminished it. Its back to the beer store for more Chimay."

The aroma was delightful and balanced with undertones of caramel and fruits. The mouth feel is extremely smooth with a perfect level of carbonation tingling the tip of your tongue. It seems full-bodied, almost hearty but remains very drinkable. As with the nose, no flavors stand out distinctively, but the blend itself is unique indeed. A perfect lacing covers all sides of the glass, fine and almost mathematically symmetrical. The alcohol content (9%) is noticeable but never overbearing.

Normally Chimay Bleue improves massively with aging, so I was looking forward to this one. It was a major disappointment! It began all right, as the beer poured a nice reddish brown with a good firm and lasting head. But the aroma was very faint, with only a bit of chocolate and some burnt flavours showing through. On the palate this brew appeared lighter than its 9% alcohol. The taste was very one-dimensional and again dominated by a burnt caracter. In short the beer appeared tired and worn out."

Grande Reserve 750ml	This beer has been kicking around my folks place for ages, I finally conned them into opening it. I knew that it would be past its best but its still an impressive drop. No head and totally flat it poured like a glass of port (not dissimmilar in aroma too). The complexity of the nose is amazing. Herbal almost medicinal in character, raisins soaked in brandy.

I regularly get chimay as its one of the best beers we can get is scotland, however while at the kulminator, i got a 1985 bottle, as that was the year i was born on. This again reinforces my high rating as this beer is just alround goodness, its always going to be a safe bet and u can drink about 10 of them which cant be said for other belgiun strong fellows. 		RERATE: Had one last night as a finisher offer, 2007 bottle thats been settlign in my room for a good few months, served at perfect cellar temp. Bottle opens and as iv found with recent bottle gushes everywhere, thankfully glass at hand, however all of the sediment is now stirred up and pours an ugly brown with many floating particals.

It turned out to be just what I had guessed it would be... a pretty nice beer that has become overrated because it is now so mass produced.  Pours a nice dark plum color with hints of ruby.  Small particles float for a bit and sink to the bottom.  Big head, but not creamy and not very long lasting.  Nose is sweet, tart and sour with a great nose of Belgian yeast.  Taste is nice... a little yeast, a little maltiness, but a little too dry for my tastes.  It certainly is a good solid beer, but not even up to par with some American Belgian Ales.  Not much body and a good solid medium carbonation that fits the style well.  Well above average, but not an unbelievable beer."

However, I found that the first time there seemed to be much more aroma - I think this time the aroma seemd trapped under the generous lasting head I poured. Anyway... What a drop - such a multitude of flavours throughout the whole sipping and swallowing process. Starts off with a rich fruity, malty and typical ale fruitiness intensity - so many different flavours come out. Followed by a wallowing progression of the hops transgression. The hops blend (I assume more than one type is used) is blended excellently, and so smoothly mixed with the malts used. Then lastly, the aftertaste, which comprises of sweet maltiness, and not overly bitter hoppiness, presented in a package which itself gives off some metallicness, astringence and bitterenss. This beer is so complex in flavour, yet so well balanced.  Incredible. Give me the recipe! Or, more importantly, give me another! The best beer I have ever tasted."

Aroma has an overall yeasty profile with some modest fruity esters in the middle and a light toasted malt presence at the tail end. Flavor starts off with a well balanced estery sweetness which transitions to a great toasted malty middle that has very light chocolate notes. Alcohol was a bit strong at the end of the tasting and added a bit of an uncharacteristically hot kick. The body is hefty but crisp with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall a fine brew. I think if the heat was a little less in this bottle it would of had a perfect blend of light toasted malt tones with a modest/strong yeast esteriness.

Faint, but the slightest faint of brown sugar, plums and raisins.		Absolutely disgusting. Alcohol is very prominent. The mellow dark fruit flavors are hidden by the candy sugar and must ""dirt like"" overtones. But the worst thing about this beer is its complete lack of body.  Its every bottle as well.

Nestles milk with melon juice and a dash of port in a sodastream bottle. Intensely sweet with the warm impact of a high alcohol content. Very rough fizz-bomb. [2.7]	 Nov, 2002:  18 month old bottle.  At room temperature it displays its best features, but unfortunately also its worst. Slightly chilled the buzz and the alcohol are reduced so the beer becomes more harmonised, but then it just becomes a muddy sludge. [2.9]	 Sept, 2004:  Murky reddish brown appearance that only a mother could love. Pleasant Belgian aroma - spicy dough and nougart. Mouthfeel is difficult - theres a pleasant creamy carbonation which melts and fades, leaving a pleasant tingle. Hmm. I think I like that mouthfeel. I would like a bit more firmness. And Im not a fan of carbonation - but this is interestingly tingly. Its a pleasant tasting beer, and the flavours are more harmonised, pronounced and balanced when the beer is at a cool rather than cold temperature. But even when the flavours are displayed at their best they are muddled and murky with a number of off flavours like plastic and parsnips along with the licorice and chocolate notes. The balance between sweet and bitter is interesting - mostly sweet, and sometimes intensely so, there are moments of assertive bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is noticeable - but its warming and gentle. I enjoyed drinking this - there is an attractiveness about this beer despite the flaws. [3.2]	March, 2005: Two year old bottle. Initially very sweet. The mouthfeel is loose - the carbonation is so fine that it never gets a grip. At this point its all about a candy sweetness and some vanilla yeast. Pleasant, but sort of babyish. When carbonation has burnt off, there are bitter notes more apparent. The bitterness is certainly more obvious at colder temperatures. There are nice flavours here (chocolate, coconut, licorice, alcohol, caramel), but there is a lack of integrity, lack of balance, lack of finesse which prevents this from being totally enjoyable. [3.1]	Nov, 2007 Compared with Brakspears Triple this doesnt hold up at all. The Triple is tasty, subtle, complex and interesting. This is simply murky, muddled, candy sweet and fizzy with an ugly alcohol presence. None of that is to say that I dislike the beer, but that its not my first choice off the shelf, and drinking it is not the pleasurable experience youd hope for. Some Band Aid, something numbing, and something odd. You gotta love the character of the beer - it certainly is a talking point. But it doesnt add up to much in the final analysis. [2.9] 	May, 2011 Each time I try this the story is the same. Its pleasant in parts, but has its weaknesses, and overall doesnt impress as a quality product. I mean, its drinkable stuff, and its OK, but its not a beer I want to rush back to. The alcohol is too obvious, the carbonation is all over the place, it burns a bit, its too yeasty and chalky, and the flavours dont meld or balance each other- theyre there, but theres no harmony. You can get good flavours out of it, but theyre not impressive flavours - theyre just decaying fruit, spice, sugar, musk etc - something different each time. Flavours yes, but most stuff has flavours. Its how the flavours meld and impress and delight that matters. I dont know which I prefer - red or blue.... [3.0]"

Aroma of slightly sweet malt, with cinnamon and other spices evident.  There is a flicker of carbonation on the tongue, although it is far less than when you drink it young. Figs, cocoa, and coriander predominate. There is also a little cinnamon and clove present.  The aftertaste is of lingering cocoa and alcohol, leaving a warmth to hang around in the back of your throat.

Not much lacing at all.  Smelled citrusy and yeasty, maybe a bit of honeydew melon in there.  Tasted vaguely like an orange peel, somewhat smoky, alcohol, malt.  Not much of a finish.  Fizzy, medium bodied mouthfeel was kind of unpleasant.  6/3/05 Re-Rate: 3.7.  (2003 Bottle, 750 ml into tulip glass).  Uncorked quickly, lots of pressure.  Yeast, bread, banana, lemon, some skunk and black pepper on the nose.  Huge fizzy fluffy grayish-beige head, rocky, with a latice of sticky lace.  Clear ruby brown in the light, darkly transluscent in the glass.  Medium body, prickly carbonation, low to medium acidity gets stronger through the finish.  Caramel and chocolate malts with a tad bit of roast, slight malted milk ball flavor and lots of musty white bread toast in the middle.  Some nuttiness in the beginning of the finish.  Some tangy mealiness in the beginning of the finish detracts, but the banana flavors in the finish are awesome.  Overall, despite all the complexity, I found the flavor profile to be kind of weak in intensity and the feel to be watery for how big the beer is, especially since I could notice the alcohol in the mouthfeel."

Color, a ruddy brown, tawny and opaque.	Head is off-white, fuzzy and activley bubbly.	Aroma: playing it quiet, actually spare, arid, Im getting nothing at all! Light echoes of nuts and toffee, wafts of maltiness. Not too happy with this aspect.	On first sip, a big blast of hops, with malt following immediately on its heels. We find that this is a brew that must be allowed time to open up, give it a little time and space...shows off earthy, nutty, chocolatey flavors, with a generous amount of zippy, zingy spark on the palate. Taste becomes better, richer, more complex and fruity. Excellent effervescence, featuring that special Belgian spark and yeasty taste. Smooth, though before long the alcoholic component kicks in and rides tall in the saddle.	Ive neglected Chimay for quite some time, perhaps after encountering Ommegang, a better tasting ale, in my opinion, when fresh, and at 1/2 the price. Perhaps Ive got to try this cellaring business to see what an older sample might offer up to us.	On this tasting, a pretty nice drink, but didnt blow me away."

I know they are supposed to be the best in the world but I am still not convinced.  Though this was better than the last one it was still just alright.  It was as carbonated as a Coke.

Oh how the mighty have fallen.  Disappointed is the best word to use here.  Tim Webb reported the demise of this once fine ale in his beer guide last year, but I wasnt convinced till this taste.  To look at it youd never know things had gone so bad.  Taking a taste removes all doubt.  I think Mr. Webbs quote ""...overtones of damp cardboard..."" says it all.  What complexity that was there before is all but gone.  I lived in The Netherlands for three years and grew to love this jewel.  All I can say is that the bottled stuff available in the US now is NOT worth the money---not even close.  I remember this used to compare very well with Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren Abt.  Those fine brews blow this one to smithereens.  Im sure its no coincidence that Chimays demise occurred just after they were bought out.  I love Belgian ales, but you should stay clear of this one until they figure out how to get their old swagger back.		A friend offered this up tonight.....it stinks just as bad in 2009.  It actually might be worse.....simply awful.....the brewery thats belching this crap out needs to be hit by a few Tomahawk missiles.......blow it to oblivion."

Is it no longer being matured for long enough by the brewery or is malt extract being used? Something is missing that I cant put my finger on, but to me, this is now a very simple beer.

Larger bubbled head than the Red Chimay. A bit fizzier. Dark purple red brown in color. Light brown head with less retention than the Red. Not a strong aroma at all. Raisins and possibly a bit of mustard. The flavor has an esophageal burn. The body is fairly thick. Sweet finish. Serious carbonation to the mouthfeel.

Given its reputation, I decided to start with the Chimay Bleue in a 33cl bottle. I was not disappointed. 	It poured a dark and cloudy chocolate/caramel color into the glass and left a creamy head which did not disappear right away, but left an enjoyable froth on the sides of my glass.	It had a much fruitier fragrance than I expected given its strength and color with yeast in for good measure. I actually found my mouth water when i wafted it in.	Again, its flavor surprised me. I have tried my fair share of beer at and over 9% apv and I usually find them overpowering but not this one. It had good dried fruit and bread/grains to the palate with a pleasant malt without the over powering sensation of a high alcohol content. It finished a mild bitter and left me swirling, smelling and sipping until it was done. I did not want to gulp it at all, which in this case was a good thing. 	Given that I am new to the Trappist beers I may have to come back to this review at some point in the future. I am not, however new to Belgian beers and this is one fine example of a good strong Belgian Ale. Undoubtedly worth a try by anyone who loves beer."

Its a treat to drink this once in a while but thank Baccus there are lighter beers. This is another beer that can have its young character changed slightly by cellaring for a year or more but it would never get to be that old in my cellar ;-)		Poured a dark slightly clouded amber with a smallish off white cap. Aromas of dates or figs or dried apricots. Started with a surprising big mouthful of sweet bready malts before the expected complex/layered banana-fig-hop undertones took over. As the beer sits on the palate the hop accent builds until the finish is surprisingly dry for a so called trappist ale.		A very delightful strong ale but this is the 3rd time Ive tasted it and it has appeared slightly different each time. This may be a matter of ingredient linearity or it could be the brewers equivilent to a ""vintage"" where there is some batch to batch character differences. All in all, a wonderful drink but may be over rated by some."

The first taste is a shock of carbonation, too much for me.  Reminds me more of a Salvator than a fine Belgian, not that I don't like Salvator.  The flavor is so lightly roasted as to be quite subtle, almost like a good brown ale.  Fruits dominate, along with floral yeasties and mild but bitter-sweet molasses.

She doesn't like beer, usually, but since we rarely see each other she went with me to the event and actually tasted many of the beers I sampled. This one she actually liked. So I bought a bottle knowing she was coming down for the weekend and thought she might want to have some. Well, she had a sip but still didn't want to drink a beer. < sigh > Oh well, I tried.		I really don't have a ton of experience with Belgians, in full disclosure, but *damn* this is good. It's very close to the Trois Pistole (sp?) from Unibrou, but I prefer this one.		Oh, I'm not using the ""correct"" glass for the beer yet again.		Pours a rather dark brown with a suprisingly white head and very little lacing. The first pour I was cautious because of the many overflows I've had with Belgians, and that left very little head. The second pour I was more vigerous, but still not too much head or any lacing.		Smells very fruity, as in raisins, apples. The scent is inviting.		Taste surely doesn't let you down. The fruits I mentioned are there as well as a few others like banana. It's spicy as well; cloves are present.		Mouthfeel is full and spicy. Drinkability suffers only from the high alcohol content, but I'll definately have more of these.		This is complex.

One sip and I immediately developed a deep appreciation for the monastic ways. The foamy tan head is rich and bubbly and while it dissipates quickly some excellent lacing is left behind. The gorgeous head sits on a deep brown body that is alive with effervescence. Has a sensational aroma of roasted malt, living yeast, alcohol, and blessed earth. Flavors of malt and yeast rush over the palate and ensnare the senses with heavenly delight while the sly 9% alcohol presence dances over the taste buds causing orgasmic convulsions at the back of the tongue. This beer made me positively giddy. With its fresh, robust aroma and peppery flavor plus its delightful eye appeal Chimay Bleu is certainly a gift from god.

Sure, its quite a nice beer, but seriously over-hyped in my view.  There's not much I can say in the way of description that hasn't been said a hundred times before. Definite prune/raisin and dark chocolate character. However, what comes through more than anything else is the caramelly candy sugar that gives it an oddly synthetic feel and a slightly cloying finish.

Bottled in August 2001. I've been aging it since then. Purchased fresh in September 2001 from Total Beverage for $10.99 each. Poured out a deep dark clear brown color. The cork shot out of the bottle when opened. Very effervescent carbonation, champagne like in every way. Subdued cream colored head that left more than a decent lacing in my Chimay chalice. Aromas are of fresh grape wine, slight malts, and rum soaked dried fruits. Figs, plums, and dates come to mind. Very aromatic, and very delicious.	Tastes are of dried, dark, rum soaked fruits, vinous, and oaky as well. Hops make a brief appearance in the middle, only to be overtaken by the rich, creamy malts. Very rich mouthfeel, thick, but not chewy. Rich, flavorful, and complex flavors and aromas describe this beer best. Finishes rich, creamy, and very filling.

Lovely soft malt flavour with some toast/biscuit notes and some alcohol. Very round and soft, yet carrying very big flavours. Just when I was thinking I didnt like this any more I have a bottle that really kicks arse. Perhaps its just the difference between the big and small bottles...Aged four years: I had a 2000 magnum last night (March 2004) which was brilliant. The beer had thinned somewhat and mellowed but the aroma had taken on a brilliant, slightly sour, cherry-type aroma very reminiscent of a Flemish sour ale. Seemed quite oaky too. Really good - subtle and complex flavour. I went back and bought the other bottle to store for a while. I would rate this a 4.4 or 4.5."

My 10th Class Reunin was this past wekend and after a long evening of dancing and drinking we ended up at a friends house for, what else, more drinking. Guests were handed bottles of Sam Addams and Pete's somethin'-or-other and then this wonderful man who I hadn't sen in 7 years brings out a bottle of Chimay!!!!!!	Glorio day! Of course noone else in the place could appreciate the earthy and subtle complexities of JUST the aroma of this beer. ""Hey, man. That's Skunked!"" Fools. DE-licious. Dark and sweet, earthy and fruity. A fine balance between the hops and malt. Truly a fine end to a wonderful night.

Deep brown color, opaque reddish-brown when held up to the light.  Massive, slowly-dissapating light tan head with excellent lacing.  Soft aroma of citrus and florals.  A veritable cornucopia of flavors - some nuttiness, very sweet and citrusy, a little bit of spiciness.  Alcohol is noticable, along with a slightly metallic taste.  Very carbonated.  Pretty easy on the palate.  This beer could easily compete with fine wines.  One of the best...ever."

The lower 2/3 of the head has a medium density bubble, while the upper 1/3 has a very fine bubble density and looks very creamy. The head retention on this beer is fantastic, and it leaves an enticing lace. The aroma has a maltiness to it, but also exhibits many earthy tones, as well as a hint of orange peel. The flavor is simply an explosion of taste. Definite citus notes, very heavy on the orange peel, but followed by caramel sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable. There also seems ot be a spiciness to the beer, with pepper and maybe a hint of coriander in the finish. There is so much going on it is hard to isolate the flavors, which blend together into a beautiful kaleidoscope of taste."

(still, this little 12 ounce bottle cost me five fat american buckeroos-- so, at that price i oughta get huge aroma, free HBO for a month and a couple discount coupons toward my next purchase).  i sniffed up some golden raisin, light alcohol, cocoa, toffee, and cork-like woody shades.   a stronger and better impact occurs  upon the tongue: a marverlous beer with micro-bubbled spritz that rolls out a red carpet for caramel apple sweetness, dark malts and fruity bakery-fresh yeast, apple butter on brown bread.  bitterness bites deeply and will not quickly yield, but echos deliciously like a sweet song in a deep canyon-- with an accent that leans to orange zest.  alcohol component certainly has nothing to be ashamed of, and walks with power and dignity among the more popular malt-hop textural aspects.  in terms of entertainment, i'd put it on a level nearly with aventinus.  it's price is it's most conspicuous defect-- hopefully the benevolent monks are feeding children in africa with the two dollars that they've overcharged for this bottle."

Dry champagne like flavor; heavily carbonated. Initial mouthfeel is one-dimensional (dry roasted malt), but some complexity prevails by mid-bottle. And, the finish is the best as all of the yeast and sediment that was sitting at the bottom of the bottle reaches the glass at final pour, providing some of the sweetness missing from the initial taste.

My first impression was that this beer was still quite good.  Had a bit of sherry in the nose, which I attribute to its age, as well as some dark caramel overtones.  The taste was still quite chimay like (imagine that).  The body was a bit thinner than younger version, and it was much more mellow with much of the esters, fruitiness, and bitterness having aged out.  Overall if I had to guess I would say that a well cared for 8 year old must be fabulous.	Sampled December 2004, 33cl bottle	Pours a fairly clear, deep ruby-amber-brown color.  It is topped by a tan head and is pretty well carbonated.  The aroma is fruity and musty, with notes of prunes, alcohol, and raisins.  The taste is sweet up front, with a rich malty center that moves to a fizzy rich finish.  This is actually quite a bit better than I was expecting it to be.  It is fairly light on the palate, especially given its strength, but it does have a slightly lingering rich malt note to it.  It is pretty fruity with concentrated notes of raisin and fig, as well as some spicy yeast notes that hint at ginger, cardamom, and clove.  The finish of this one reminds me some of sweet apple cider, it has a certain sharp, almost acidic fruity finish to it that is pretty interesting."

Hazy brown hue with reddish highlights, covered by a moderate-sized tan head consisting of very large bubbles, which is quite short-lived.  Lots of cola in the aroma, followed by brown sugar, dates, rhubarb, prunes.   Hm, somewhat medicinal as well (aspirin), blending into some dry, grassy hops.  Toasted bread with cherry jam.  Husky and tannic, also.  The flavour is somewhat better, lacking any real aspirin flavour, but still failing to really impress.  Moderately sweet from start to finish with high acidity, and a prickling, peppery finish.  Quite flat on the tongue, watery despite being medium-full in body, with prickling carbonation.  Not so impressive any more, no.		75 cL bottle, tulip glass.  Large, off-white head stays fairly well.  Body is a deep brown with a red hue.  Rich aroma is nutty, spicy, with a hint of alcohol.  Lightly sugary also.  Flowery hops; nutty toasted bread/grain malt; mold and cobweb yeast.  Moderately sweet throughout with light acidity and light bitterness at the end.  Warm spices play well off the sweetness.  Medium-heavy body is creamy with lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: head could be denser, theres a little alcohol in the aroma and flavor, and too much carbonation (for me); but its damn fine in the way it all comes together."

There is a smokiness that I get from this beer at first sniff.  Whether it's supposed to be there or not, I'm not sure, but it is there.  Roasted grain is noticeable once it starts to warm;  yeastiness and dark fruits (plums);  smokiness is still there.  Fairly dry for a strong dark.  Starts a little malty sweet then turns decidedly bitter and dry.  Hop flavor creeps into the aftertaste.  Roasted grain is mixed into mid palate along with yeast.  Dark fruit seems to be missing from this one in the flavor profile and is not quite as complex as I'd hoped, but it's not a bad beer.  Carbonation is on the higher side and has a probably lighter than actual m/f due to that fact.  This one is not one of my favorites for this style.  It seems to lack a little complexity and all in all just doesn't really ""do it"" for me.  After reading some of the other ratings, I either have a bad bottle, or my taste buds are just off.

Ive had this beer from the bottle a few times.  I maintain that it is somewhat overrated, as there are better belgians Ive had.  Red, brown gold tones in the color with a range of peachy citrus to nutty/alcohol in the aroma.  VERY full bodied, meaty beer though.  Its almost like drinking a beer off the filter.  Certainly complex, and provides a variety of flavors when drunk at different temperatures. Too much head for my liking, but was to be expected off such a yeasty beer.1983 bottle sampled in August 2005.  Has aged magnificently.11/05 vintage dated 750mL bottle drunk on 7/7/07Raisins, pears, figs, apples and other mostly clean Belgian yeast esters, with caramel sweetness in the background.  Its a pleasant aroma, though even after only 3 months, my memory recalls little to distinguish this beer.  Or perhaps, more accurately, my memory recalls that there really is little to distinguish in this beer.Similar flavor profile, your typical well-made Quad, with soft malty sweetness (caramels, raisins, prunes, figs) and lighter, minimally tart apple/cherry esters towards the end.  Yeast seems more clean and less ""rustic"" or ""charming"" or what have you, than in past samples.  Musty, corky, earthy and woody are flavors I associated with this beer, for the better, but now its just a rather plain Belgian Dark Strong.  Nothing wrong with it, but hardly anything Ill go out of my way to drink again.  Alcohol well concealed, no flaws.  Score is for this bottle."

Rich blackberry and dates hit the nose the second the cap is opened, before theres even been a chance to pour it into its matching Trappist glass.		From the glass you also can pick up a deep, rich sweetness not unlike port, as well as the immediate berry and date aromas.		On the tongue it begins with malt, toffee and spices, followed by the deep port-like flavours and a dry, lightly tart finish with warming alcohol. Barely a hint of hops to speak of - the rich complexity derives mostly from the malt and Belgian yeast. Silky mouthfeel.		Given a few more years ageing this could be spectacular.

Medium strength caramel aroma, with unmistakable oxidization vein, but not annoying; very light impression of dust and pond water too. It has a good body structure, stronger than most 20yearsold beers tasted so far, yet quite flat; caramel flavor, sweetish; the ageing created an extra flavor of mellow liquorice; almost no trace of bitterness, instead the sweetness is balanced by the alcohol, that is easily perceived through a pervasive warmth in the mouth. Interesting, but not outstanding.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 1998 (bb 2003), 12 years old, 7-4-6-3-13=33The cap is in good conditions; it pours a dark brown color, darker than the 1988; the head is initially large, but even after some time its still half a centimeter thick. Medium to light aroma, with some caramel and soap; also very light vanilla, wood, cake, nuts and Madeira; pleasant. Being more carbonated than the 1988, the mouthfeel seems lighter; its undoubtly less sweet, even if there is a residual sweetness; there is some caramel flavor, less oxidization, and equally lack of bitterness, as well as there is almost no alcohol warmth.

Medium to light aroma, with some caramel, soap, refined sugar, yeast. Average body structure, definitively slimmer than the 1988, possibly drier than the 1998; there is some caramel flavor, quite boring indeed; some more bitterness than in the other vintages, more balanced therefore; the final is also a bit nutty, and the alcohol warmth is just what is expected from a 9% beer.

It smells too much the cork, with some caramel too, and a touch of cellar. Medium body (maybe less than the fresh one), with a good dark caramel flavor. The bitterness is almost gone.

What head did form is a pale tan  with gray notes.  		<P>Theres a strong yeastiness to the aroma, almost like bread dough just as it starts to bake. The aroma is also very grapey/winey. It reminds me immediately of the wine the church I went to as a child uses for Communion. Below the yeast and wine I noticed a smell making me think of Rollos and Caramel Twix with light chocolate and caramel malt aromas.		<P>The flavor is an exercise in the melding of light and darkness. The bright flavors of bubblegum esters, yeastiness, the very faint sourness common to the style, chalk and the alcohol (very faint and only at the end) made for a very bright character that both contrasted and complimented the dark tones of the chocolate and caramel, a slight burnt bitterness and an even fainter smokiness. I was especially surprised to pick up on the burnt and smoke flavors, two flavors Ive never noticed in any of the Belgian strong dark ales.		<P>The palate is surprisingly carbonated considering the wimpy head but lacks the cottony carbonation that many of the lighter strongs (including Chimay Red) have that turns me off. The carbonation here balance the slightly creamy mouthfeel nicely.		<P>I was really surprised by this beer. Its probably one of very few of the style that Id actually buy on a regular basis."

Any beer with the potential to reach such greatness deserves such a rating, and it would get a solid 5.0 if it were like this all the time.  Incredible!!  Yeasty, champagnelike aroma.  Wine-ish, absolutely wonderful malty presence.  The complexity of this by far exceeds anything else I have ever tasted.  Where do I start?  Apples, pears, chocolate, prominent and somewhat Westvleteren-like yeast that I can still taste in my mouth an hour later.  I cant imagine how good this would be after 10 or 15 years.  RE-RATE #1: I have to re-rate this as one of my top 5.  In a time when Im trying to have as many new beers as possible, this is something that I keep buying and coming back to.  Chimay Bleu : beer snob :: Budweiser : redneck.  Great stuff.  Fruity taste, complex, caramel, woodiness, slight nut.  Malty finish, good balance, TONS of head.  I brought a bottle of this to a party the other night that had 3 kegs of Lone Star, just so I could be as out of place as possible.  I theorized that if I tapped anything from the kegs into my Chimay chalices, they would instantly shatter.  RE-RATE: Just had to give it another point, this is one that I always come back to!  No better way to end a stressful week than downing a 750 of this and some good food."

Served at room temperature, I enjoyed the perfect head over the deep mysterious brown liquid.  The aroma is seductive--enormously complex.  A swallow yields warming, but wonderfully restrained, alcohol.  And so happy that the carbonation is in check.  But I cant say that there is really a lot of flavor here.  I tried this after a Schneider Weisse and found the latter to have a much richer flavor.  I was surprised.  This beer has changed, or I have."

Les esters fruits sont modrment prsents et prennent la forme de prunes et de raisins en lgre confiture.  Lalcool, qui est peu intense, partage son odeur agrable avec des fleurs fraichement coupes.  Le got est bien peu diffrent des armes avec des grains malts qui laissent sur les papilles des notes subtilement rties, des saveurs imbriques de levure fruite et quelque chose comme des saveurs florales pices.  En bouche, le liquide, qui a une structure passablement toffe, est remu par des bulles dune grande finesse qui sont,  mon sens, un peu paresseuses.

The older the beer, the more fruitier, the more port-like and certainly more alcoholic. After 10 years of aging there isn't much taste-change anymore. After about half a year - year the beer is so much fuller of taste; it's a waste to drink rather new chimays. Just let them rest for a while.

Totally unexpected, but it sure made me happy. Slightly dissapointed by the beer though. Lots of head on the pour. Very fruity, more so as it warmed. Good, but nothing special.

This one still doesnt do it for me quite like the other trappistes but I still cant quite put my finger on it. Sure it looks nice and has a lasting beige head. The aroma is delicate but its still a bit faint, and this time I made sure I let it warm up. The typical spices, hop, fruit and yeast  aromas and flavours of the typical Belgian Strong Ale style are also all there. Theres just no WOW! factor like you get when you take that first mouthfull of the top Belgians. Maybe because this beer is so well known or maybe its just my mouth and nose are different.

Gorgeous color; head was not particularly dense--i.e. larger bubbles.  Carbonation was striking in the palate--champagne-like tingles, more than to my taste.  Aroma was the let-down; not as rich as expected or as the flavor ultimately held.  The smoothness of the beer is striking--complex flavors, mild sweetness, some spice (nutmeg perhaps)--but all without being hit on the head by any of them.  It went down very fast, which is unfortunate considering the high alcohol, which hit very quickly after just 200ml!  (2002 vintage, .33L bottle)"

Apart from fresh Chimay Bleus ive also tasted two, three and (thanks to jbrus) five, ten, 15 and 20 year old ones. A fresh Chimay is nice, malty and a bit yeasty with notes of raisins, liquorice and some alcohol. However, it is nothing compared to aged one. After two years the flavour has not really changed much, but after 3 years an obvious difference occurs, its much more complex: malts, chocolate, coffee, fruits, raisins its all there. After five years the flavour has changed so much you wouldnt recognize it being a Chimay Bleu. Its more fruity and alcoholic, with an obvious port-like aroma and flavour. A ten year old one was IMO the best of the whole collection: incredibly full flavoured with long-lasting (alcoholic) finish and the aroma was one of the best ive ever experienced. Carbonation is totally lost in bottles aged for more than five years (NO head), but who cares? Its great! Remarkably, the 15 year old bottle was inferior to the 10 and 20 year old bottle. In conclusion, the flavour changes the most after five years of aging and reaches an optimum after 10 and 20 years (and perhaps even later...?). Additional note: Recently also sampled a four year old bottle (Grande Reserve 99). The flavour of this bottle was really in between a 3 year old (which still has the ""fresh"" Chimay Bleu flavour) and 5 year old (which is has totally different, more port-like flavours). My personal conclusion is that, if you want to drink a ""fresh-flavoured"" Chimay Bleu, you should stick to 3 year old bottles (much more complex than new bottles). After the turning point (5 years or older) more port-like, alcoholic and fruity flavours can be detected, which make it totally different from the ""fresh"" taste. This aged flavour is (IMHO) at best after 10 years (but still excellent after 20)."

This brew pours a dark murky brown with red highlights and some tiny particles.  The huge mostly diminishing frothy off-white head has fair lacing.  The soft but rich nose is flowery, fruity, spicy (pepper, ginger, brown sugar), citrusy, and alcoholic.  The flavor is balanced, rich, wine-like and complex with apple, citrus, pepper, prunes, anise, and traces of vanilla.  The alcohol is well hidden.  The medium dry body has lively carbonation, and finishes moderately alcoholic, and lightly astringent.  The Rouge has better flavor, but this brew is better all around especially on the palate."

It certainly tastes quite a bit like many of the wine products I have sampled over the years. One of the most original beers I have tried and liked. It rich color and taste lead to a strong aftertaste that sits with you for a while. The alcohol content is definitely felt."

Personally, while I loved the look, and while I gave it every kind of temperature test, I didnt care for the taste.  Perhaps I got a bad bottle, or perhaps this is really what it tastes like.  Unfortunately, Im inclined to believe the latter."

I was going to save some of the 750ml bottle I bought, but I finished it in one sitting.  It got better as it warmed up (or was it the 9% alcohol that warmed up my belly).  Complex malt characters with a good balance of bitterness.  No noticable hoppy aroma and flavor.  A little too much carbonation in my opinion, but I did drink all 750ml."

Dark, rich roasted carmeley flavors, figs, raisins, dates, and bread come to the tongue.

Has a moderate aroma of stewed fruit and fruitcake. Flavour wise, there is lots of sweet fruit (raisins and plum), with some caramel and toffee.

The clean, fruity aroma and nice foam preceded a taste of dark cherries or maybe strawberries with a hint of chocolate.  The finish is slightly bitter but not sour and disappears quickly.  It doesnt detract from this one at all.  Its too heavy to drink all the time, but Im already looking forward to my next bottle.

At first closed (cellar temperature is 14 C), opening to a breadlike aroma with some spice, pepper.	Foamy in the mouth, with an intense and full flavor, licorice, quite hefty structure.  Good balance between sweetness, body and alcohol, not as overtly herby/hoppy as the Chimay Premire/Red I had yesterday, with a quite heavier body and licorice type predominance, but also some musty bitter in the end.	Quite a mouthful, but not as expressive as the Chimay Premire/Red which I found to be the better beer."

Chimay is the standard that others are compared to! Fairly rocky head, but it didnt last nearly as long as I rememberd in the past. Nice orangey-brown color.

Lately it has become a beer thats above average but certainly not one of the best anymore. Just try drinking 2 good beers (4.0 and above) and a Chimay Blue in 1 row. I did and Chimay Blue sudenly doesnt seem that great anymore. Butterscotch and apple aroma. More like a Doppelbock than a BSA. Light hazy, ruby color, beige head, fair lace.

Nose is pleasant, slightly vinous, not strong enough.  Flavor -- wow! very sweet, malty, some alcohol hints (it IS 9%) but not enough to detract -- very complex and hard to grasp in just one bottle.  Beautiful cognac-like effect going down.  In short, great! 8/5/9/5/18=4.5		November 2003:  2002 bottle.  Seems much drier, more acidic, bit cardboardy in the flavor and less distinctive in the nose.  Bummer, maybe this is going downhill. 7/4/8/4=3.8		July 2004:  1.5 liter, 1993, shared with TAR and cb.  Massive caramel nose,  wisps of vanilla, whisky.  Huge plumminess, figs, caramel, dates; fairly dry finish, but black currants and brown sugar are present through to the end; dark thick brandy color; mostly quite full, but a bit thin late. 9/5/10/4/18=4.6		Conclusions:  drink this beer aged; I suspect that 10 years or so is just about right.  The plummy barley wine characteristic really suits the beer well and more than compensates for the aged thinness late in the mouthfeel.  This rating is an average of the three scores."

The sweetness and malts were present in the falvor, as well as an alcoholic kick.  Aftertaste was mellow and somewhat musty.  Very nice.

It blew me away.  Over the years, Ive felt that while it is a complex, tasty beverage, it has been eclipsed.  Whether it is me or the beer is debatable - and indeed the topic of the perceived decline of Chimay beers over the past decade is one of the most heated in the world of beer geeks.  Well, I finally decided to sit down and give this a proper re-rate.  Ive got a small bottle of 2004 from my local liquor store. The colour is kind of unusual in that there is a big disparity between the colour - under the light its a golden brown but in the glass its dark chestnut. The head is very light mocha.  The aroma is plummy, slightly bubblegummy with notes of honey, pears, sweet dark malts and a little bit of yeast.  Nice.  It has a sweet palate with pear, orange, and sultana notes.  A strong alcohol presence cuts through dusty yeastiness.  Flavour notes are well-fused, save for the obtrusive alcohol."

Aroma of rum-soaked spice cake, raisin, estery yeast,    and dark bread.   Dark, opaque brownish red in color with ample carbonation and head.  Profoundly sweet and fruity, with a variety of dessert and baking spices, raisin and lightly warming alcohol.  Aftertaste is long, spicy, having a scant amount of hop flavor and continuing maltiness.  Really really good.  My first ever true Belgian Ale experience years ago."

Overall aroma was exactly that of The Cheeky Monk Belgian Beer Cafe in Denver, CO.  Though to be more specific, it was beautifully yeasty with a primary note of blueberry, accompanying other Belgian-ish dark fruits.  Taste was fruit centric, the blueberry from the aroma coming back into play, with the standard Belgian characteristic tastes of yeast and a touch of malt.

This rises high but falls quickly, leaving not much lacing; but a swirl reinvigorates about a fingers worth.

In the mouth its drier than I expected, and drier than most quads; though it shares those essential qualities of spices, malts and honey.  The hops seem fresh on this.

Its quibbling, but its the truth: if you are going to spend $12 on a bomber of Belgian ale, you should go with Bernardus Abt, Malheur 12, or Chimay blanche. This remains one of the finest ales in the world, but its plum flavors succumb to the tiniest hint of sourness in the flavor. The body is also thinner than in some of those other classics, but that is quibbling indeed. A delightful beer that pairs beautifully with beef, the fact that I can readily name other beers that are better than this one is a tribute to other brewers rather than an insult to these noble monks."

Thats okay. As big as my Blue is, I dont expect all that much head to linger around; itd just get in the way of her nose. Melted brown sugar, nutmeg, and molasses are slather atop candied fruits: prunes, dates, figs, and raisins. A dash more candied sugar and I move right into a vineyard of black grapes and fine ruby Porto. More brown sugar sprinkles and visions of Christmas cake, hold the sugarplums, bring me to canned black cherries. Oh yes, heaven is here once more and all is right in my world. As much as I could smell my Chimay all day long, there be drinking to be done. Some will pooh-pooh the effervescence brought on by bottle-conditioning, but Blue is a rich sweet heavy brew whose playful effervescence serves the very important task of cleansing your palate for a continually pleasurable quaffing session without being overpowered by cloying sweetness. Molasses and spice mingle with nutmeg while my tastebuds take in the fruit-felt bounty of raisins, prunes, black cherries (fresh and canned), and grapes before ending in licorice. There is a pervasive candied sugar sweetness which isnt overpowering thanks in part to her effervescent body. Her palate centers all immediate pleasures on the top of my tongue, though as we further our temptuous relationship, the back of my tongue and throat dries with spice and wood. For a brief moment, I have flashes of tropical paradise in the form of candied pineapple, and then she is gone. As my Blue warms, her flavors continue to melt into, with, and around each other in practiced Belgian Trappist artistry. As ruby Porto warms my body and soul, I find my Chimay chalice empty. Thats okay though; I still have the other half of my 750ml bottle to savor further.			I can definitely taste how with more age the Chimay Grande Reserve (Blue) would grow drier and develop richer ruby Porto notes. The potential was already there and growing with just a little over a year in the bottle. A beer to enjoy fresh and laid down, never buy just one."

It has some sweetness to it mingled with a touch of sour and bitter.  I remember this beer being better the first time, but it wasnt as cold either.  Perhaps if I warm it in my hands, the full flavors will come out.  As I type, the aftertaste is pleasant, reminding me of my childhood and warm breads and figs.

Served in a champagne flute side by side with Chimay Red and Chimay cheese. Mahogany and amber brown in color, nice head that quickly recedes. Fruity and floral aroma, although not as big in the nose as I would have guessed. Bready, biscuity with some dark fruits like plums, raisins and licorice in the taste. I thought this had very similar flavors than the Chimay Red, but they are exaggerated and very bold in the Blue.  Well carbonated with that Belgian yeast characteristics in the finish. Alcohol presence is a little more detectable here than in the Red. This is a great sipping beer to have buy a fire, although the big alcohol presence might want me to limit to one glass.

Nearly exploded on me when I opened it, disturbing all the yeast, so I got a rather yeasty pour and cant say what the clear brew is like.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Off-white head. Smell of Belgian yeast. Slight hayish flavor with that yeast REALLY taking over in the end. A very good beer if it werent for my unreadiness for secondary fermentation and lousy pouring technique."

A beautiful opaque dark brown pour with a reddish hue, nice creamy head that lasts and leaves good lacing.  Flavor is fruity, medium sweetness, earthy, malty goodness.  The yeast is a significant factor in the aroma and flavor.  Very lively carbonation is somewhat overwhelming at first but is better after it sits a bit.  Full bodied with an oily texture and clean, smooth finish.  This is a beer to write home about, pretty amazing."

Im afraid I didnt leave it standing long enough and when I popped the cork all of the sediment on the bottom stirred up in the bottle so it poured with some serious chunks. A nice amber brown with a decent white head. Nose is complex with deep fruits, and sweet malts. Mouth is similar with some caramel sweetness and a bit of alcohol, though neither is overbearing. Nice, complex and well balanced. definitely worth revisiting."

Pretty good head retention.		The aroma is full of fresh plums, sour cherries, and a bit of green apple. Some pleasant yeastiness, some mild spiciness (clove, cinnamon). Some roasted malts, with hints of caramel.		The taste starts out very fruity, with lots of fresh plums and some sour cherry-like tartness. Then you get some caramel breadiness, with just a hint of chocolate. The finish is still fruity, with just a bit of dryness and very light bitterness.		Exceptional is a good way to describe the mouthfeel. Its very smooth, yet somewhat crisp. Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. Not boozy for a 9% beer. Some warming sensation at the swallow. Very pleasant overall!		The one bottle I had went down very easily and smoothly. I guess the drinkability is good for a strong ale, but moderation is strongly advised here, because the alcohol is quite well-masked!"

Murky reddish brown with the thinnest of heads sits nicely in my cup with riseing carbination. The aroma is that special yeast as promised with some dark fruit or palmagranite in there as well. Flower aromas confussed me since i was drinking outside and was not sure if it was just coming fromt he beer or the budding flower garden.

Flavour is quite yeasty with floral notes from the hops. A malty sweetness develops through the middle, accompanied by notes of candied fruit, brandy and grapes. The finish is long and malty. On the palate, this beer is moderately astringent, medium-full in body with a smooth texture. Overall, an excellent brew. Complex and subtle, its the ideal accompaniment to an evening of philosophical meandering. Considerably less malty than Chimay Rouge, but notably more aromatic and alcoholic. 2010-03-20"

T - Rum soaked dark fruit (raisin, fig, date, currant), Along with a general spiciness (predominantly clove), Alcohol is also fairly prominent, much more than in other similar beers. There is also a good amount of dark sugar and caramel, but these are not too cloying. Very slight bitterness and the end balances these out a bit.		M - Moderate carbonation and probably on the higher side of medium bodied. It probably could be a bit fuller, but that is just kind of nit-picking.		D - Could probably drink 2 in a night and be fine, any more would probably be too much (even if the ABV was lower). It definitely hits the spot though, and is a nice beer to sip at night.		Notes: I do really like this beer. However, compared to other similar and comparable beers, I dont think it holds up as well. Not really a knock on it, it is just in great company. That said, the availability of this beer is certainly a plus, and if I saw it for a good price, I would be all over it."

Chimay Bleu has a deep caramel brown body with a tiny, off-white head, which fades rapidly into the brew shortly after pouring. Nose is boozy, with lots of figs and raisins. Taste is vinous; candy sugar, yeast notes and toffee all emerge within seconds. Aftertaste is boozy, almost like port wine and caramel-like. A nice brew, although not quite up there with its genre ""counterparts"": the quadrupels. I know its not really in the same category, but it feels like it shouldve been, particularly when the rest of the Chimay series (rouge = dubbel, blanche = triple) kinda promises a quad at the end of the series. It also seems to aspire to reach f.ex. Rochefort 10 in complexity, however failing to do so. Nevertheless, good value for your money and a very nice beer in general."

However, when such a situation presents itself the rookie might find himself forced into taking an opinion he doesnt truly have. Thats how I felt about Chimay Blue Grand Reserve. Its roundly regarded as one of the best beers on the planet, and while I did enjoy it, I couldnt say I honestly felt the same way.This is a very complex and flavorful beer, however, its also a challenge to drink and it didnt amaze me the way I expected to. I can see why its so highly regarded by connoisseurs, but from the perspective of a regular beer drinker I have to admit its just very good.APPEARANCE AND AROMAChimay Blue is available in capped 330ml and corked 750ml bottles (which is what I drank). The bigger bottle is easy to open and easy to pour, although it does come out of the bottle in glugs with lots of kickback. Its complexion is similar to a raspberry iced tea with a dark maroon color with an extremely hazy, cloudy complexion. Because its a bottle-refermented beer its extremely carbonated with tons of tiny bubbles constantly rising from the bottom of the glass. It initially forms a thick, fluffy layer of off-white, soapy head but it fizzles away surprisingly fast and doesnt leave any lacing on the glass. There is noticeable sediment poured from the bottom of the bottle.The aroma is strong and indicates dark fruit like plums and raisins, along with a powdery yeast component. A bready maltiness is also detectable, but the beer is not nearly as flowery as the brewers website indicates. The alcohol is very well masked since it is virtually unnoticeable.TASTEHaving already tried the Chimay Red and White, I found the taste of Chimay Grande Reserve to be quite familiar. Upon my first swig my tongue was peppered with spices. This followed by a fairly rich flavor of dark fruit which in turn was finished with a bready maltiness. As I continued to drink I felt the beer has a palate quite reminiscent of red wine as sour grape, plum and fig are the most prominent flavors. But much like the aroma, the palate also contains a significant dry component, which I assume to be the Trappist yeast strain. Its slightly sour and slightly dry, but most of all its tasty. As the beer warms it takes on an apple cider-like taste, making the palate something of a fruit cornucopia. I liked it, but I couldnt help but feel something was missing: namely chocolate or some kind of darker, harsher flavors to balance the palate. Sure theres a breadiness from the malts, but Id prefer something stronger, maybe even burnt-like to negate the sourness from the fruit. At least theres no bitterness or watery texture to the palate, so even the most inexperienced n00b could tell Chimay Blue is a beer with chutzpah. DRINKABILITYIve never been a big fan of bottle-conditioned beers since their abundance of yeast tends to make for extremely carbonated beverages. Chimay Grande Reserve is quite bubbly from the initial pour to the last drop and never shows signs of relenting. Therefore, its a very gassy beer which means its difficult to drink except in sips. The mouthfeel is rather heavy as well, although its actually quite smooth as goes down.I made a point of drinking Chimay Blue after a large dinner in order to prevent the 9% ABV potency from overwhelming me. However, I was quite surprised at just how quickly the alcohol went through my system. After less than one glass, Chimay Blue really made its mark. Additionally, the sheer density of the beer cannot easily be shaken off as its a brew youre going to notice for quite a while.FINAL THOUGHTSConsidering the reputation of this beer Im actually a little disappointed that I didnt jump for joy over Chimay Grande Reserve. I genuinely enjoyed the taste and appreciated its complexity, but was a little distracted by how much of a challenge the beer was to drink. Regardless, I can honestly say I liked it and would highly recommend it. At $10 for a 750ml bottle its a good buy, and if youre a beer connoisseur its practically a steal.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6gC8zx563I"

As you drink, the flavors become darker and more complex.  An earthy presence evolves coinciding with the ever present malty backbone.  The finish is slightly dry with plumb, brown sugar, tart green apple, a touch of spice, floral notes (rose), and a well-integrated splash of booze.  Full bodied with a frothy mouthfeel and a low level of carbonation.  Phenomenally well balanced; showcases the abv while integrating it into the flavor.  I absolutely love this brew."

Its perfect for introducing fizzy water fans to the world of real beer flavor.		Now that Ive tried many more Belgian ales (and especially other Trappist ales like Rochefort, Westmalle and Achel) I find Chimay Blue to be less than great when you compare against the benchmark they set. It touches your palate with a sense of excitement but it quickly dissipates. That makes it incredibly pleasant to drink, but dont expect to be wowed by flavor, aroma, maltiness or yeast while you devour this very drinkable ale. 		Its got a good balance of each, but that balance makes it less distinctive and memorable. A very good beer, but not one I will sell my soul for."

Aroma of roses and cherry candy as well as malts and roasted malts; there are nuances of wine and wild berries. Flavor! Wow! This is a chart buster but here I have to give it the limit of 10. Okay, Il transfer the bonus points where I can. Wild berries accompany the malts in the mild but delightful sweetness. There is a wine-like expression in the aftertaste, a cherry cough drop linger, and then a nice clean finish. This beer has tied on my scoreboard with its own sibling,  Chimay Triple / Blanche"

Small bottle. Pours a dark and murky copper with largeish head but it diminishes faster than the white or red. Nose is musky with hints of raisin and dough. Taste is out of this world...layered and sophisticated. Slightly sweet and yet evidently bitter. A roasted malt back reveals aspects of dusty roasted chestnuts with fruitcake and yeast. Finish has a hop bite that dances on the tongue. Slightly boozy but not offensive. Despite the youth of this bottle it offers everything I remember this beer for. In other words good young or aged. Top quality and my favorite of the Chimays.

Sweet floral aroma, not of hops but of sweet flowers like honeysuckle, delicate and subtle, yeast detectable, honey, dark fruits.

Caramel and brown sugar play a sweet song, written by toffee. Swirling overripe bananas dance by, barely able to stand, but still present and making a good show of it. Yeast is trying to hold them up but has been drinking Port all night and is now chewing bubblegum, trying to hide it.		Dark fruits and tasty, sweet malts dominate. Caramel and molasses. Nice spicy bite at the end. Good yeasty notes.		Nice and creamy feeling, but abit lacking, overall, in the mouth. Would benefit greatly from abit more oomph.

A woody malt start flows slowly into a rich fruity mid with carmelly finish.  A delicate and incredilbe transition of flavors, like really good scotch. The spices noted in the nose intermingle with rich dark fruit malts and elegant belgian yeast in a most pleasant balancing act.  You taste alchohol but its only one character in a complex mingle.		Palate is equally complex and marked by smooth and definite transitions.  Mild tang and tingle build to sour character while the mouth becomes increasingly silkly.

Also, I could tell it was going to be a bitter beer due to the ever-prevalent smell of hops. As I poured it into my glass, it produced a very dark, amber, golden color. It was a little translucent - bordering opaque. It formed a white/gold head that was retained for a good 5 minutes or so. After I let the beer settle, I took a taste and got a hint of fruit - a bitter one; almost reminiscent of the peel of a citrus fruit (orange). There was also a bit of spice from the roasted ingredients used in the beer. As the beer enters, you can taste the alcohol and hops right from the get-go. After the initial hit, the beer mellows out quite nicely and on the way down it smooths out. It almost seems like wine with the progression of textures and sensations. I also noticed the aroma of the wood that the beer was fermented in. Overall, this was a very filling beer. It would go nice with a small, but hearty, meal. If you have too much food, I can see it overfilling you. The bitter taste of the beer is strong, but pleasant and not overpowering to the overall flavor. I greatly enjoyed this beer."

Much to my chagrin, I try it tonight, and I find it getting a lower score than some other beers Ive rated.  I only got a two ounce sample tonight, maybe thats why?  Maybe because its not in the 750 ml cork bottle that I usually drink it from?  I dont know.  I do know the aroma is nothing to write home about and the appearance looks like diarrhea.  The flavor, as ever, is as good as beer gets.  My overall impression, even from this two ounce sample, is 19/20, which means I dont give much stock to the aroma or appearance.  This is a phenomenal tasting beer.  I think I will re-rate this beer when I get a 750."

Cellar-cold, it had timid head. Perhaps it had done some time in a cellar. It was neither outspoken fruity nor bitter, not sweet and sour neither. Some graininess in its mouth feel (dust). Modestly lasting after-taste. It is balanced and that goes hand in hand with less clear palate. Too high priced compared to the 33 cl version which seemed more tasty to me. Therefore, on memory, I give palate more than this bottle deserves, same with overall imp. Appearance can sure do better next bottle."

The beer pours a deep ruby-colored/brown color with a nice off-white head.  The aroma brings fruit cake, raisons, Belgian character malts, and some yeast-derived dark fruity esters (which I found surprising, given the use of the Chimay house yeast).  The palate is deeply and complexly malty, showing some Munich at first, Special B, and perhaps a touch of aromatic malt.  The malt gives way to a deep and pleasing note of dark fruit.  The finish is semi-dry, and brings just barely a touch of alcohol that is more warming than present from a flavor perspective.  Overall, one of the best Belgian strong darks out there."

There is a fair bit of fruit to this one as well like dates and perhaps some fig. I also detected some brown sugar and vanilla as well but this seems to come and go. As the beer sits and gets a chance to open up a little some chocolate and spice become more pronounced as well. A very complex smelling beer & one that is great on the nose.		Pours a dark sort of reddish brown almost chestnut colour with a tan white head about two fingers width high. The head appears quite bubbly that stays put for quite some time before finally reducing to a thin lacing over the surface of the beer. It may have something to do with the fancy teku glass I poured it into but even after the head recedes this one still looks fantastic.		Again quite sweet upfront with a a faint alcohol kick to it that is part sugar, part spice. Some good chocolatey malts and hints of caramel along with the dark fruits noted in the smell. An amazing taste to this one with a malty sweetness and a great creamy taste added to the fact the beer is incredibly well balanced and tastes great.		Medium bodied and quite rich on the palate with medium carbonation. It is really smooth and goes down much easier than a 9% beer should. There is still a solid alcohol kick to it and the finish is relatively light in bitterness.		Simply amazing, this beer is without a doubt one of the best I have tried so far. It has great depth and an fantastic smell coupled with a solid feel and brilliant taste, its almost perfect. No doubt one that Ill find myself going back to time and time again, perhaps not quite as much as some slightly less rich beers but definitely a world class ale & one that you should definitely try if you havent already. Ill be picking up a few more of these to cellar pretty soon.		Featured in my 1001 Beers to Try Before You Die Blog:	http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"

Pouring a rich brown, this one is rather cloudy.  No worries, I DO like sediment in my beers.  Now thats a head!  Probably the biggest Ive ever seen from a bottle of this size, it was like a light brown milkshaked, and departed with some nice lacing as a parting gift.

The color is a very dark hazy brown. Aroma is yeasty and nutty with some deep malty sweet notes and some plum like fruitiness. Flavor is very good, the malty sweetness is very present here but its not cloying, this is one of those where the alcohol seems to balance the sweetness, which I always find is either brilliant or a total disaster, more often its the latter of those two but in the case of this beer it is brilliant.

Nose is very expressive, unmistakably trappist. Caramel, chocolate, rum & raisin and a slight oaky nutty character aswell. Palate is a little more simple. Malt comes through early brining caramel/choc. Nutty/oaky character pops up again before hops and spicy phenols drive the finish.

Poured a beautiful dark copper color with yeast haze and vigorous beige foam, lasting with excellent Belgian lace. Aromas of rising dough, fresh baked bread, caramelized brown sugar, only a hint of spicy hops, fruity and peppery yeast esters, and alcohol. Extremely rich malt sweetness: flavors of bread, toast, biscuits, toffee, plums, apricots, raisins and dried cherries, with very mild hops bitterness. Medium body and full, ""chewy"" mouthfeel. Alcohol could be felt, smooth and warming, but not at all harsh or overpowering. Dry finish, particularly for such a malty beer, with a lasting peppery aftertaste. No single aspect dominated; this beer could be the very definition of well-balanced. An absolute masterpiece of brewing, one of the greatest."

Cloudy, mahogany-brown colour, with a medium sized dense, tanned head. Dark, sweet malts, especially dark fruity ones: Plums, currants, dried berries stand out in the aroma. Followed by a light spiciness,  cloves, very light black pepper. Not very yeasty for a big Belgian but just enough to add to the aroma. Medium to heavy sweet taste, much like the aroma: I detect a lot of the same dark fruits, alongside brown and candy sugar flavors. Hints of chocolate, bread and the subdued yeast make this beer complex and enjoyable. With warmth, the dark fruits take on a longlasting finish with notes of raisins and dark, dried fruits. A light warming effect from the alcohol. Full-bodied with soft carbonation. A super smooth, complex beer with high drinkability."

Hinted at a fullness that wasnt quite there though (needs to be aged a couple of years). Fl: Candy sugar and fruity esters w/ succulent plums and more clearly, dry fruits coming through.

Aroma: Very strongly aromatic beer, at first coocoo candy, moderately alcoholic, hiding veru robust and strong, essential character, woody - nutty touch (especially wallnut), notes of raisin, resin, Porto wine, strong spices, leavy, herbal hops (really well hopped beer), red wine grapes, flowery accents, especially rose.

Lovely dark fruit and sweet Belgian candied sugars fill the nostrils.  Easy grains and more Belgian fruit/yeast flavors follow behind.  Lovely.		Flavor is lovely grape juice, plum, raisin, sweet malt, sugar and Taylor Swift.  I imagine that if Taylor were a beer she would be sweet and innocent.

Beautiful fluffy white head with a burnt orange appearance with an unfiltered cloudy haze. Nose is of all things Belgian. Sweetness, spicyness, and malt. The yeast gives this such complexity for a Tripel that it is many things going at once on the palate and nose. The hops and yeast in this are a perfect match. The fluffy head lasted the entire way with sticky lacing too. My favorite Tripel for sure. Preferred on draft although by the bottle is damn good too."

Highly carbonated - cork and suds flew out of there like champagne!  Poured into a snifter.  Orange in color, slightly hazy.  Huge pale head.  Aroma is very grainy, like fresh bread, with just a touch of sourness in the background.   Also earthy with just a little fruity component, but I cant identify it.  Taste was more hoppy and bitter than I expected and the alcohol was very pronounced, but after warming a bit it became much smoother and better balanced.  It coats the inside of my mouth and leaves a nice lingering bitterness.  Let this one warm a bit and its great.UPDATE:  I finally got some real Chimay glasses and had some of this beer on hand.  I have to say that the proper glassware made a great difference in an already great beer.  The etching in the bottom keeps that fine head throughout the short life of the glass and the open top really brings out the brighter flavors in the aroma.  The flowery hops and yeasty sourness really come forward to compliment the grainy parts.  This is definitely the way to enjoy this beer!"

Aromas of bread, dough, flowers, grass and citrus. Excellent flavors of hops and fruitiness with a slightly bitter finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation that tingles on the tongue.  A very well made tripel, one of my favories."

Lots of white head at the top, but I later found out that I stored it improperly (store upright, not on its side). Strong taste, cant tell the flavor, but its strong. I prefer Chimay Red more than White."

The nose is very fruity with bananas and candied orange.  There is a nice hoppy bitterness on the tongue and it finishes crisp with a nice bitter after taste.  Nice carbonation and the alcohol is nicely hidden.

The head eventually dropped to 1/4 inch but never faded totally. The beer is a highly-carbonated bright amber orange, and its quite attractive. (Food should please the eyes as well as the palate.) The aroma is surprisingly hoppy with a underlying sweet malt and hints of fruit. The aromas are precursors to the flavor palette. A complex blend of hoppy, fruity and yeasty. There are a range of spices lingering in there as well; pepper, cinnamon are noted. A faint candy sweetness waits in the background. The aftertaste has some drying bitterness with peachy fruitiness in the end. I found the alcohol to be very well-masked."

Definitely foams more than the the Chimay Blue. Very good taste, has a decent spice taste but much less than the Chimay Blue. The alcohol content is not as prevalent as the Blue. Would buy again."

Golden in color, with a thin white head that leaves lots of lacing.		Smell is a bit underwhelming, with spices and mustiness.		Taste is medicinal with lots of spices and yeast.  Theres also a bright estery fruitiness.  Some booziness is apparent here.		Carbonation is a bit high.  Lightness in body contributes to the booziness taking over the palate with too much warmth."

I surprised that I had not rated this one before. Lucky for me that Beertopia breaks up the holiday pack and sells these individually. Pours deep gold with an enormous concrete-like off white head. This head stays rock hard throughout the drink. It is almost a solid. The aroma is mildly fruity, but also has a bread dough scent like the baking of rolls. The flavor has a mid point sweetness that gives rise to a big orange peel bitterness on the back of the tongue that just sits there and gouges you. Plenty of black pepper on this one as well."
